# RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION AND CHUNKING METHODS

[Report](https://github.com/buinguyenkhai/project1-20241-rag-and-chunking-methods/blob/main/prj1_rag_and_chunking_methods_report.pdf)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework that combines
retrieval-based and generative models to address the limitations of purely generative systems,
particularly in tasks requiring factual accuracy and contextual relevance. A critical factor influ-
encing the performance of RAG systems is the choice of chunking technique used to preprocess
source documents for retrieval. This study evaluates the impact of three prominent chunking
strategies—Naive Chunking, Small2Big Chunking, and Proposition Chunking—on the per-
formance of a RAG system applied to a question-answering task. Extensive experimentation
highlights the trade-offs between these methods in terms of retrieval precision, response qual-
ity, and computational efficiency.

0,what percent of people are overweight in the uk?,34%,uk,"1. Main facts and figures in the year to November 2022, 63.8% of adults aged 18 and over were overweight or living with obesity - up by 0.5% from the previous year 70.8% of black adults were overweight or living with obesity - the highest percentage out of all ethnic groups 33.1% of adults from the Chinese ethnic group were overweight or living with obesity - the lowest percentage in the 6 years to November 2022, the percentage of white British adults who were overweight or living with obesity went up from 62.0% to 65.2% - it also went up for adults in the mixed (from 53.8% to 60.1%) and white 'other' (from 57.0% to 59.1%) ethnic groups the percentages were broadly similar to those from the year ending November 2016 for all other ethnic groups 2. Things you need to know What the data measures The data shows the percentage of adults (people aged 18 and older) in England who were overweight or living with obesity, by ethnicity. People were asked for their height and weight. These figures were used to determine their body mass index (BMI). This indicates if a person is overweight or living with obesity. Not included in the data How BMI is calculated The metric formula for working out someone's BMI is their weight in kilograms divided by their height in metres squared. The ethnic groups used in the data Estimates are shown for 7 ethnic groups: Asian black Chinese mixed white British white 'other' 'other' This means estimates are shown for these groups as a whole. This is because the number of people surveyed was too small to make any reliable conclusions about any of the 19 ethnic groups used in the 2011 Census. People often underestimate their weight and overestimate their height. This means their self-reported body mass index (BMI) is known to be lower than it actually is. The data adjusts for this bias by using a formula based on observations from the Health Survey for England over several years, which included both self-reported and clinically-measured BMI figures.

and obesity increases with age up to age 64, reaching the peak in the 55 to 64 years group (72.8% and 32.4% respectively) then decreasing in the 65 to 74 years and older groups. Prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults by deprivation and ethnicity Prevalence of overweight (including obesity), and obesity is highest in those living in the most deprived areas (71.5% and 35.9% respectively) and lowest in those living in the least deprived areas (59.6% and 20.5% respectively). When looking at different ethnic groups, the prevalence of overweight (including obesity) and obesity in adults remains highest amongst those who identified as black (74.8% and 34.8% respectively) or white British (65.3% and 27.6% respectively). Physical activity and inactivity in adults (aged 19 years and over) In England in 2022 to 2023, 67.1% of adults were physically active. This is similar to 2021 to 2022 (67.3%) and the pre-pandemic level in 2018 to 2019 (67.2%), but higher than 2015 to 2016 (66.1%). 22.6% of adults were inactive in 2022 to 2023 which is similar to 2021 to 2022 (22.3%) and 2015 to 2016 (22.3%). Women are less likely to be physically active than men (64.9% compared to 69.6%) and are more likely than men to be inactive (24.0% compared to 21.0%). The proportion of physically active adults decreases with age; adults aged 19 to 24 years have the highest percentage of physically active adults (73.2%) decreasing to 56.0% and 30.7% in adults aged 75 to 84 years and 85 and over respectively. The proportion of adults who are physically inactive is highest in the 75 to 84 (33.2%) and 85 and over (57.3%) age groups and much lower among adults aged between 19 and 64 where the range is from 17.7% to 21.7%. Physical activity and inactivity in adults by deprivation and ethnicity 53.9% of adults living in the most deprived areas are physically active compared to 74.0% of adults living in the least deprived areas, while 35.3% are inactive in the most deprived areas compared to 16.1% in

a day (19.2% and 21.0% respectively). The proportion is highest among white British adults (32.9%). Further information The indicators published in the Obesity Profile present local authority estimates from Sport England's Active Lives Adult Survey (ALAS) data to help inform local action to improve the health of the population now and into the future. A detailed description of the methods used to produce the indicators can be found in the definitions data view of the indicators in the Obesity Profile. Data on adult overweight and obesity prevalence The best indicator of obesity prevalence for adults at a national level comes from the Health Survey for England, which uses measured height and weight to calculate body mass index (BMI). However, the survey sample size is not sufficient to produce robust estimates at local level. The indicators presented in the Obesity Profile use self-reported height and weight from the ALAS which are adjusted so that they more accurately predicted measured values. The 2022 to 2023 obesity prevalence of 26.2% is similar to the latest available estimates from the 2021 Health Survey for England (HSE) (25.9%) which also used adjusted self-reported measurements due to the COVID-19 social distancing restrictions in place at the time. 2022 data from HSE will be available later in 2024 and this will be the first estimate of obesity prevalence since the pandemic to use measured heights and weights making it comparable with pre-pandemic HSE data. Data on physical activity The Health Survey for England is the best source for physical activity data at a national level. The HSE allows for comparison over a longer time period, providing data for 2012, 2016 and 2021. The HSE also provides a more complete summary of activity levels as it includes physical activity while at work and other non-occupational activities such as housework, manual work and DIY activities, in addition to activities covered by ALAS such as gardening, walking, and sports and

Obesity is a global and complex public health concern. It is associated with reduced life expectancy and is a risk factor for a range of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, liver, and respiratory disease, and can also impact on mental health. Fruit and vegetables are part of a healthy, balanced diet and can help the public stay healthy. Evidence shows there are significant health benefits to getting at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. Understanding the data, the trends and patterns enables us to make the case for national and local action, and approaches to create health-promoting environments. The Obesity Profile also includes data on inequalities in these indicators, displaying data by index of multiple deprivation decile, ethnic group, working status, disability, level of education, socioeconomic class, age and sex. Main findings Prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults (aged 18 years and over) In 2022 to 2023, 64.0% of adults aged 18 years and over in England were estimated to be overweight or living with obesity. This is similar to 2021 to 2022 (63.8%) but there has been an upward trend since 2015 to 2016 (61.2%) (Figure 1). In 2022 to 2023 26.2% of adults were estimated to be living with obesity. This is similar to 2021 to 2022 (25.9%) but, as with the prevalence of overweight (including obesity), there has been an upward trend since 2015 to 2016 (22.6%). Figure 1: prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults (aged 18 years and over) In 2022 to 2023, the prevalence of overweight (including obesity) was higher among men (69.2%) than women (58.6%), however the prevalence of obesity in adults was similar among men (26.4%) and women (26.2%). Prevalence of overweight (including obesity), and obesity increases with age up to age 64, reaching the peak in the 55 to 64 years group (72.8% and 32.4% respectively) then decreasing in the 65 to 74 years and older groups. Prevalence of

weight individuals, obese individuals cause significant economic productivity loss (ranging from $13.4 billion to $26.8 billion in 2016). The obesity rate has steadily increased since 1960–1962, where approximately 13% of American adults were obese. By 2014, figures from the CDC found that more than one-third (crude estimate 36.5%) of U.S. adults and 17% of children were obese. By 2014, figures from the National Institute of diabetes shows that 82% of Americans are overweight. National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC showed that 42.4% of U.S. adults were obese as of 2017–2018 (43% for men and 41.9% for women). For the following statistics, ""adult"" is defined as age 20 and over. The overweight + obese percentages for the overall US population are higher reaching 39.4% in 1997, 44.5% in 2004, 56.6% in 2007, 63.8% (adults) and 17% (children) in 2008, in 2010 65.7% of American adults and 17% of American children are overweight or obese, and 63% of teenage girls become overweight by age 11. In 2013 the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 57.6% of all American citizens were overweight or obese. The organization estimated that 3/4 of the American population would likely be overweight or obese by 2020. According to research done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, it is estimated that around 40% of Americans are considered obese, and 18% are considered severely obese as of 2019. Severe obesity is defined as a BMI over 35 in the study. Their projections say that about half of the US population (48.9%) will be considered obese and nearly 1 in 4 (24.2%) will be considered severely obese by 2030. New data in 2024, reveals the U.S. adult obesity rate decreased by about 2% from 2020 to 2023, according to data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Researchers attribute this decline in part to the increasing use of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic, now used by 6% of Americans. These",1,1,4,5
1,who won the battle of gettysburg union or confederate?,Union,Union,"The Battle of Gettysburg (locally ) was a three-day battle in the American Civil War fought between Union and Confederate forces between July 1 and July 3, 1863, in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle, which was won by the Union, is widely considered the Civil War's turning point, ending the Confederacy's aspirations to establish an independent nation. It was the Civil War's bloodiest battle, claiming over 50,000 combined casualties over three days. In the Battle of Gettysburg, Union Major General George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, halting Lee's invasion of the North and forcing his retreat. After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led his Confederate forces through Shenandoah Valley to begin the Gettysburg Campaign, his second attempted invasion of the North. With Lee's army in high spirits, he intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged Northern Virginia in the hopes of penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or Philadelphia, which he hoped would convince northern politicians to abandon their prosecution of the war. President Abraham Lincoln initially prodded Major General Joseph Hooker to move his Union forces in pursuit of Lee, but relieved Hooker of his command just three days before the battle, replacing him with Meade. On July 1, 1863, as Lee's forces moved on Gettysburg in the hopes of destroying the Union Army, the two armies initially collided, and the battle commenced. Low ridges to the northwest of Gettysburg were initially defended by a Union cavalry division under Brigadier General John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. Two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, however, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, leading them to retreat through the streets of Gettysburg to the hills just south of the city. On the second day of battle, on July

The Gettysburg campaign was a military invasion of Pennsylvania by the main Confederate army under General Robert E. Lee in summer 1863. It was the first time during the war the Confederate Army attempted a full-scale invasion of a free state. The Union won a decisive victory at Gettysburg, July 1–3, with heavy casualties on both sides. Lee managed to escape back to Virginia with most of his army. It was a turning point in the American Civil War, with Lee increasingly pushed back toward Richmond until his surrender in April 1865. The Union Army of the Potomac was commanded by Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and then (from June 28) by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. After his victory in the Battle of Chancellorsville, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia moved north for a massive raid designed to obtain desperately needed supplies, to undermine civilian morale in the North, and to encourage anti-war elements. Lee's army slipped away from Federal contact at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on June 3, 1863. The largest predominantly cavalry battle of the war was fought at Brandy Station on June 9. The Confederates crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains and moved north through the Shenandoah Valley, capturing the Union garrison at Winchester, in the Second Battle of Winchester, June 13–15. Crossing the Potomac River, Lee's Second Corps advanced through Maryland and Pennsylvania, reaching the Susquehanna River and threatening the state capital of Harrisburg. However, the Army of the Potomac was in pursuit and had reached Frederick, Maryland, before Lee realized his opponent had crossed the Potomac. Lee moved swiftly to concentrate his army around the crossroads town of Gettysburg. The Battle of Gettysburg was the deadliest of the war. Starting as a chance meeting engagement on July 1, the Confederates were initially successful in driving Union cavalry and two infantry corps from their defensive positions, through the town, and onto Cemetery Hill. On July 2, with most of both armies now present, Lee

Breadcrumb Gettysburg Adams County, PA | Jul 1 - 3, 1863 The Battle of Gettysburg marked the turning point of the Civil War. With more than 50,000 estimated casualties, the three-day engagement was the bloodiest single battle of the conflict. How it ended Union victory. Gettysburg ended Confederate general Robert E. Lee's ambitious second quest to invade the North and bring the Civil War to a swift end. The loss there dashed the hopes of the Confederate States of America to become an independent nation. In context After a year of defensive victories in Virginia, Lee's objective was to win a battle north of the Mason-Dixon line in the hopes of forcing a negotiated end to the fighting. His loss at Gettysburg prevented him from realizing that goal. Instead, the defeated general fled south with a wagon train of wounded soldiers straining toward the Potomac. Union general Meade failed to pursue the retreating army, missing a critical opportunity to trap Lee and force a Confederate surrender. The bitterly divisive war raged on for another two years. On June 3, soon after his celebrated victory over Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Gen. Robert E. Lee leads his troops north in his second invasion of enemy territory. The 75,000-man Army of Northern Virginia is in high spirits. In addition to seeking fresh supplies, the depleted soldiers look forward to availing themselves of food from the bountiful fields in Pennsylvania farm country, sustenance the war-ravaged landscape of Virginia can no longer provide. Hooker also heads north, but he is reluctant to engage with Lee directly after the Union's humiliating defeat at Chancellorsville. This evasiveness is of increasing concern to President Abraham Lincoln. Hooker is ultimately relieved of command in late June. His successor, Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, continues to move the 90,000-man Army of the Potomac northward, following orders to keep his army between Lee and Washington, D.C. Meade prepares to

The Battle of Gettysburg was fought July 1-3, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point. Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, ending Lee's attempt to invade the North. After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North--the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade. Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of town to the hills just to the south. On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On

The Battle of Gettysburg, fought from July 1 to July 3, 1863, is considered the most important engagement of the American Civil War. After a great victory over Union forces at Chancellorsville, General Robert E. Lee marched his Army of Northern Virginia into Pennsylvania in late June 1863. On July 1, the advancing Confederates clashed with the Union's Army of the Potomac, commanded by General George G. Meade, at the crossroads town of Gettysburg. The next day saw even heavier fighting, as the Confederates attacked the Federals on both left and right. On July 3, Lee ordered an attack by fewer than 15,000 troops on the enemy's center at Cemetery Ridge. The assault, known as ""Pickett's Charge,"" managed to pierce the Union lines but eventually failed at the cost of thousands of rebel casualties. Lee was forced to withdraw his battered army toward Virginia on July 4. The Union had won in a major turning point, stopping Lee's invasion of the North. It inspired Lincoln's ""Gettysburg Address,"" which became one of the most famous speeches of all time. Battle of Gettysburg: Lee's Invasion of the North In May 1863, Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia had scored a smashing victory over the Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville. Brimming with confidence, Lee decided to go on the offensive and invade the North for a second time (the first invasion had ended at Antietam the previous fall). In addition to bringing the conflict out of Virginia and diverting northern troops from Vicksburg, where the Confederates were under siege, Lee hoped to gain recognition of the Confederacy by Britain and France and strengthen the cause of northern ""Copperheads"" who favored peace. Robert E. Lee On the Union side, President Abraham Lincoln had lost confidence in the Army of the Potomac's commander, Joseph Hooker, who seemed reluctant to confront Lee's army after the defeat at Chancellorsville. On June 28, Lincoln named Major General George Gordon Meade to succeed Hooker. Meade",5,1,5,4
2,what did george washington do as a teenager?,Surveyedm Land,Surveyor,"Contents Article The youth of George Washington (1732-1799), the first President of the United States, remains the least understood chapter of his life, shrouded in folklore and myths. Yet the experiences of his youth, and the bond he felt toward his older half-brother Lawrence, shaped the man he was to become and helped put him on the path toward revolution and the presidency. Young George Washington with His Father John C. McRae after G. G. White (Public Domain) This article examines what is known about the lineage and youth of George Washington, from the first time his great-grandfather set foot on the shores of Virginia in 1657 until George's own coming of age in 1753, a year before the shots fired at the Battle of Fort Necessity changed the trajectory of his own life and, it can be argued, of world history. Tall, strong, and somewhat physically awkward, the young George Washington grew up on a plantation just outside of Fredericksburg, Virginia, and moved to Mount Vernon as his brother's ward shortly after the death of their father. He became a land surveyor at the age of 16, measuring over 60,000 acres of land along the unmapped western frontier of Virginia. When Lawrence contracted a fatal case of tuberculosis, George accompanied him to Barbados, the only time he ever left the boundaries of the future United States; while there, he had a short but painful bout with smallpox, and for the first time came face to face with the military might of Great Britain. He had experienced much by his 21st birthday in 1753, although nothing could have prepared him for what was still to come. Family & Parentage The story of the Washington family in Virginia begins with a shipwreck. On 28 February 1657, the merchant vessel Seahorse of London ran aground on the shoals of the Potomac River during a storm; laden with precious tobacco, the ship had just embarked on its return voyage to England. Among its crew was a young Englishman named John Washington (b. 1633), who had taken

Barbados had led him to dream of martial glory, much like his idolized brother Lawrence had achieved at the Siege of Cartagena during his service in the War of Jenkins' Ear. Love History?

In 1753, word reached Virginia that the French had begun to build forts in the Ohio River Valley, on lands that had been claimed by the Ohio Company, which had been partially founded by Lawrence Washington. Governor Dinwiddie, who was an investor in the Ohio Company, dispatched George to demand that the French leave the territory at once. George Washington's decision to accept the mission, although undoubtedly fueled by his lust for glory, was also made from the experiences of his youth. He was compelled to defend the claims of the Ohio Company both out of love and loyalty to his older brother and because of his own experiences as a surveyor of western lands, lands he believed rightfully belonged to Virginians. Whatever his reasons, Washington's journey into the West in 1753 would change the trajectory of his life, putting him on the path to becoming a soldier and, ultimately, president of a nation he would help forge, the United States of America.

was remarried to 23-year-old Mary Ball. Childhood & Education Mary Ball Washington gave birth to her firstborn son at Wakefield at 10 a.m. on 22 February 1732. His name was George. His birth would be followed by five younger siblings: Elizabeth (1733-1797), Samuel (1734-1781), John Augustine (1736-1787), Charles (1738-1799), and Mildred (1739-1740). In 1734, Augustine moved his rapidly growing family 60 miles (96 km) up the Potomac River to the Little Hunting Creek plantation, where he could keep a closer eye on his lucrative ironworks. He ordered the construction of a house on this property that would form the basis for Mount Vernon. Before long, Augustine moved the family once again, this time to the Ferry Farm estate near Fredericksburg, Virginia; it was here where George Washington spent much of his youth. The supposed instance in which George Washington was unable to lie to his father about chopping down a prized cherry tree was later fabricated. Not much is known about George's childhood; indeed, in terms of historical scholarship, it remains the murkiest chapter of his life. He was certainly raised on the Ferry Farm plantation, and likely attended a local school in Fredericksburg, where he excelled in the subjects of geometry, trigonometry, and mapmaking. Some of his school papers survive, in which he copied out sets of moral teachings from the book Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation; these 'rules', which included such counsel as ""in the presence of others, sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet"", showed George how to be a proper Virginian gentleman, guidance he would follow for the rest of his life. Folkloric stories about George's childhood - such as the supposed instance in which he was unable to lie to his father about chopping down a prized cherry tree - were later fabricated, to fill in the gaps in this unknown part of his life. In 1743, Augustine Washington unexpectedly died. At

George Washington: Life Before the Presidency Breadcrumb George Washington: Life Before the Presidency On February 22, 1732, Mary Ball Washington gave birth to the first of her six children, a boy named George. George's father, Augustine, had been married once before and had three older children from his previous marriage. Over the next several years, the large family moved a few times, before settling at Ferry Farm on the banks of the Rappahannock River near Fredericksburg, Virginia. When George was eleven, his life changed radically. His father died, and George's older brothers inherited most of Augustine's estate, including Little Hunting Creek Plantation, which later became Mount Vernon. George inherited one of the smaller estates and ten enslaved individuals who worked the farm. Without a large inheritance, George relied on his family and connections to make his way in the world. Unlike his older brothers, he did not have the opportunity to study at a university. He spent his teenage years learning how to manage a plantation from his mother and mastering the science of surveying with the assistance of his neighbor, Colonel William Fairfax. In 1751, George accompanied his favorite older brother, Lawrence, on a trip to Barbados. While in the Caribbean, George came down with smallpox. He survived and left the island with lifelong immunity, but the disease probably left him unable to father children and with a firsthand conviction about the dangers of the disease. The trip to Barbados was also formative for Washington's future. He toured the military structures on the island and was increasingly interested in a military career. Initially, George wanted to join the British Navy, and Lawrence promised to help secure him a position. Mary, George's mother, had strong reservations about the physical abuse her son might receive in the navy and the limited possibilities for advancement. She was probably right, as life in the navy was often brutal and short-lived. With his

At only 11 years old, George inherited Ferry Farm as well as ten enslaved people. Too young to fend for himself, he was sent to live with his eldest half-brother, Lawrence, who had inherited the Little Hunting Creek estate and had renamed it Mount Vernon, in honor of British Admiral Edward Vernon, his commanding officer in the War of Jenkins' Ear. George idolized and adored Lawrence and soon tried to emulate the ""grace, bearing, and manners"" of his refined older brother (Freeman, 5). Eventually, George would come to regard Lawrence as both a father figure and a best friend. Lawrence Washington seemed to be a good role model for the young George as he was quickly making a name for himself in Virginia. In 1744, he was elected to the House of Burgesses and, a few years later, helped found the Ohio Company, a land speculation company that was chartered to settle the uncolonized lands of the Ohio River Valley. Lawrence also married Anne Fairfax, the daughter of his influential neighbor Thomas Fairfax, whose patronage would soon affect George's life. Surveying Career After finishing his education, George's proficiency in mathematics led him to consider a career in land surveying, which at the time was considered a respectable path to wealth and social advancement. In 1748, at the age of 16, George Washington set out on an expedition into the wilderness of the Shenandoah Valley to survey the properties of Lawrence's father-in-law Thomas Fairfax. It was to be the first time George set foot off the lands where he had grown up on the Virginia Neck, and he kept a diary to recount his experiences on this, his first real adventure. Led by Thomas' son, George William Fairfax, the surveying party proceeded along the bank of the Potomac River, setting out on 14 March 1748; that night,",1,1,1,4
3,what is the name of the capital of belgium?,Brussels,City of Brussels,"Brussels, city, capital of Belgium. It is located in the valley of the Senne (Flemish: Zenne) River, a small tributary of the Schelde (French: Escaut). Greater Brussels is the country's largest urban agglomeration. It consists of 19 communes, or municipalities, each with a large measure of administrative autonomy. The largest commune--which, like the greater metropolitan area, is named Brussels--contains the historic core of the city and the so-called ""European Quarter,"" where the institutions of the European Union (EU) are located. Greater Brussels officially became the Brussels-Capital Region in 1989, during the federalization of Belgium. Along with the much larger regions of Flanders and Wallonia, the Brussels-Capital Region constitutes one of the country's three main political divisions. As the seat of the EU, Brussels is known as the ""capital of Europe,"" and its significance as a centre of international governance and business makes Brussels a true global city--a status shared with such metropolises as New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo. Area Brussels-Capital Region, 62 square miles (161 square km). Pop. (2022 est.) Brussels-Capital Region, 1,222,637; Brussels commune, 188,737. Brussels is the administrative, commercial, and financial heart of Belgium, and the majority of services and institutions of national importance are based in the city. Brussels is, in addition, a major European tourist and cultural attraction, functioning simultaneously as a regional metropolis and an international centre. The last-named role has flourished since the city became host to the European Communities (ultimately succeeded by the EU) as well as to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) headquarters. The city lies just a few miles north of the invisible ""language boundary"" separating Belgium's Flemish-speaking region of Flanders in the north from the southern, French-speaking Walloon Region. Brussels is thus surrounded by Flemish territory. Although historically it was a

Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels, which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is located in the central portion of the country and is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the Flemish Region (Flanders), within which it forms an enclave, and the Walloon Region (Wallonia), located less than 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) to the south. Brussels grew from a small rural settlement on the river Senne to become an important city-region in Europe. Since the end of the Second World War, it has been a major centre for international politics and home to numerous international organisations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants. Brussels is the de facto capital of the European Union, as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions, including its administrative-legislative, executive-political, and legislative branches (though the judicial branch is located in Luxembourg, and the European Parliament meets for a minority of the year in Strasbourg). Because of this, its name is sometimes used metonymically to describe the EU and its institutions. The secretariat of the Benelux and the headquarters of NATO are also located in Brussels. Brussels is the most densely populated region in Belgium, and although it has the highest GDP per capita, it has the lowest available income per household. The Brussels Region covers 162 km2 (63 sq mi) and has a population of over 1.2 million. Its five times larger metropolitan area comprises over 2.5 million people, which makes it the largest in Belgium. It is also part of a large conurbation extending towards the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, and Leuven, known as the Flemish Diamond, as well as the province of Walloon Brabant, in total home to over 5 million people.

as well as the province of Walloon Brabant, in total home to over 5 million people. As Belgium's economic capital and a top financial centre in Western Europe with Euronext Brussels, Brussels is classified as an Alpha global city. It is also a national and international hub for rail, road and air traffic, and is sometimes considered, together with Belgium, as Europe's geographic, economic and cultural crossroads. The Brussels Metro is the only rapid transit system in Belgium. In addition, both its airport and railway stations are the largest and busiest in the country. Historically Dutch-speaking, Brussels saw a language shift to French from the late 19th century. Since its creation in 1989, the Brussels-Capital Region has been officially bilingual in French and Dutch, although French is the majority language and lingua franca. Brussels is also increasingly becoming multilingual. English is spoken widely and many migrants and expatriates speak other languages as well. Brussels is known for its cuisine and gastronomic offer (including its local waffle, its chocolate, its French fries and its numerous types of beers), as well as its historical and architectural landmarks; some of them are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Principal attractions include its historic Grand-Place/Grote Markt (main square), Manneken Pis, the Atomium, and cultural institutions such as La Monnaie/De Munt and the Museums of Art and History. Due to its long tradition of Belgian comics, Brussels is also hailed as a capital of the comic strip. == Toponymy == === Etymology === The most common theory of the origin of the name Brussels is that it derives from the Old Dutch Bruocsella, Broekzele or Broeksel, meaning 'marsh' (bruoc / broek) and 'home, settlement' (sella / zele / sel) or 'settlement in the marsh'. Saint Vindicianus, the Bishop of Cambrai, made the first recorded reference to the place Brosella in 695, when it was still a hamlet. The names of all the municipalities in the

About this Item Title Other Title Summary This late-18th century French map shows Brussels, at that time an important city in the Spanish Netherlands and the capital of the Duchy of Brabant. The map shows the borders of the city and the Senne River. The location of the city on the river made it an important commercial center for trade between France and the Germanic states. In 1695, Brussels was attacked by the army of Louis XIV, and suffered heavy damage. It remained under siege off and on until it was captured by the French in 1746. Brussels became the capital of Belgium when it became an independent country in 1830, and in 1958 was made the seat of the European Economic Community, the precursor to today's European Union.

Belgium's Flemish-speaking region of Flanders in the north from the southern, French-speaking Walloon Region. Brussels is thus surrounded by Flemish territory. Although historically it was a predominantly Flemish-speaking city, at present the majority of residents in the Brussels agglomeration speak French, which is also the preferred language of the city's growing international labour force. The city is bilingual, and in all spheres of public life Flemish and French are used side by side. Nevertheless, in the 20th century Brussels became the principal venue for political and cultural clashes between Flemings and Walloons. Partly as a result of these conflicts, the Belgian parliament reorganized the country's structure on the basis of the Flemish, Walloon, and Brussels-Capital regions. Although the Brussels-Capital Region maintains a separate political identity, the city of Brussels also functions as the capital of the Flemish Region and as the capital of the country's French- and Flemish-language communities. Although the average visitor to Brussels might remain unaware of the various governmental powers vested there, the interdigitation of municipal, national, and European politics has contributed to many of the city's problems. It has, for example, impeded the harmonious development of the city's spreading built-up areas as well as its public transportationinfrastructure, already hindered by an automobile-friendly street plan. Moreover, national and transnational interests have at times taken precedence over the interests of local residents. There is no question that Brussels is a polarized place. Dilapidated neighbourhoods in the centre-west and west stand in stark contrast to manicured lawns, restored townhouses, and posh suburban villas in the east and southeast. Dated industrial infrastructure lies a few miles from the astringent glass-and-steel administrative district of the EU. Yet, its urban pathologies aside, Brussels is not a city in decay but a place",1,1,5,4
4,who does darth vaders voice?,James Earl Jones,James Earl Jones,"Darth Vader () is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He was first introduced in the original film trilogy as one of the leaders of the Galactic Empire. The prequel trilogy chronicles his transformation from the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. His metamorphosis begins when he is lured to the dark side of the Force by Chancellor Palpatine, who later becomes the Emperor. After a lightsaber battle with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader is severely injured and is transformed into a cyborg. He serves Palpatine for over two decades, hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel Alliance. When Palpatine tries to kill Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, the Sith Lord turns against his master and destroys him. Vader is the husband of Padmé Amidala, the father of Luke and his twin sister Leia Organa, and the grandfather of Ben Solo (later known as Kylo Ren). David Prowse physically portrays Vader in the original trilogy, while James Earl Jones provides his voice in all of the films and some television series. Sebastian Shaw portrays Anakin in Return of the Jedi (1983), while Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen portray Anakin in the prequel trilogy, with Christensen reprising the role in the series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and Ahsoka (2023). In the standalone film Rogue One (2016), Vader is portrayed by Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous. The character also appears in novels, comics, and video games. He has become an iconic villain of cinema. == Creation and development == === Darth Vader === As part of the development for the original Star Wars film, George Lucas hired the artist Ralph McQuarrie to create conceptual images for the characters. For Vader, Lucas asked McQuarrie to depict a ""very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind."" Because the script described Vader traveling between spaceships, McQuarrie suggested that he should wear a space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie

had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind."" Because the script described Vader traveling between spaceships, McQuarrie suggested that he should wear a space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie created Vader's iconic mask by combining a full-face breathing mask with a samurai helmet. A 1975 production painting by McQuarrie depicts Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller, who later became Luke Skywalker. Vader is shown wearing black armor, a flowing cape and a skull-like mask and helmet. This early design was similar to Vader's final appearance. Working from McQuarrie's concepts, the costume designer John Mollo devised an outfit that combined clerical robes, a motorcycle suit, a German military helmet, and a military gas mask. The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armor. The sound of Vader's breathing was created by the film's sound designer, Ben Burtt, using modified recordings of a scuba breathing apparatus. The sound effect is trademarked at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Lucas has provided differing accounts of how the name ""Darth Vader"" originated. In a 2005 interview with Rolling Stone, he claimed it was a modified version of ""Dark Father."" On another occasion, he said it was inspired by the phrase ""Dark Water"". It is also possible that ""Darth Vader"" originated from the name of Gary Vader, a boy who went to high school with Lucas. The names of various Star Wars characters have been altered in countries outside the United States. In France, Vader's name was changed to Dark Vador (pronounced [daʁk vadɔʁ]) starting with the original film. Although the names of some other characters have been reverted to the English versions over the years, Vader is still referred to as Dark Vador in recent French-language Star Wars media. The title ""Darth"" has been replaced with ""Dark"" for other Sith Lords as well. In Italian-language editions of Star Wars films, Darth Vader was called Dart Fener (pronounced [ˌdar(t) ˈfɛːner]) starting

David Charles Prowse (1 July 1935 – 28 November 2020) was an English actor, bodybuilder, strongman and weightlifter. He portrayed Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy and a manservant in Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange. In 2015, he starred in two documentaries concerning his Darth Vader role, one titled The Force's Mouth, which included Prowse voicing Darth Vader's lines with studio effects applied for the first time, and the other titled I Am Your Father, covering the subject of the fallout between Prowse and Lucasfilm. Prior to his role as Vader, Prowse had established himself as a super-hero figure in the United Kingdom as the Green Cross Man in Green Cross Code media aimed at teaching children and young people road safety. == Early life == David Charles Prowse was born on 1 July 1935 in Bristol, England. He was the son of Gladys (née Burt) and Charles Prowse. He was brought up on the Southmead housing estate in Bristol, gaining a scholarship to Bristol Grammar School. Prowse was tall, standing 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), and developed an interest in bodybuilding. His early jobs included a bouncer at a dance hall, where he met his future wife, at Henleaze Swimming Pool. Following his successes from 1961 in the British heavyweight weightlifting championship, he left Bristol in 1963 to work for a London weightlifting company. == Career == === Weightlifting and training === Prowse won the British heavyweight weightlifting championship in 1962. The following two years he represented England in the weightlifting event at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia. During his bodybuilding course, Prowse became friends with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno. Prowse could deadlift as much as 784 lb (356 kg) and was notable for being the first person to lift the Dinnie Stones. During his prime, Prowse weighed around 282 pounds (128 kg). During the 1970s, Prowse developed a minor interest with wrestling and trained many

in 1975. As a result of his association with the campaign, which ran between 1971 and 1990, he received the MBE in 2000. He had a role as Frank Alexander's manservant, Julian, in the film A Clockwork Orange (1971), in which he was noticed by the future Star Wars director George Lucas. He played a circus strongman in Vampire Circus (1972), a Minotaur in the Doctor Who serial The Time Mon",5,1,5,1
5,who was the italian leader in ww1?,Vittorio Emanuele III,Benito Mussolini,"Utility navigation Annexed navigation Italy Enters World War I When World War I began in July 1914, Italy was a partner in the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, but decided to remain neutral. However, a strong sentiment existed within the general population and political factions to go to war against Austria-Hungary, Italy's historical enemy. Annexing territory along the two countries' frontier stretching from the Trentino region in the Alps eastward to Trieste at the northern end of the Adriatic Sea was a primary goal and would ""liberate"" Italian speaking populations from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while uniting them with their cultural homeland. During the immediate pre-war years, Italy started aligning itself closer to the Entente powers, France and Great Britain, for military and economic support. On April 26, 1915, Italy negotiated the secret Pact of London by which Great Britain and France promised to support Italy annexing the frontier lands in return for entering the war on the Entente side. On May 3, Italy resigned from the Triple Alliance and later declared war against Austria-Hungary at midnight on May 23. At the beginning of the war, the Italian army boasted less than 300,000 men, but mobilization greatly increased its size to more than 5 million by the war's end in November 1918. Approximately 460,000 were killed and 955,000 were wounded in the conflict. Objects from the Museum's Collection This service record is for Antonio Zanussi, who served in the 2nd Engineers. Zanussi was conscripted in February 1917, entered the service March 17, 1917 and fought in the campaign against Austria-Hungary in 1917-18. The record states that Zanussi served with good conduct and faithful service. This postcard honors the memory of Captain Giuseppe Tagliamonte, commander of the 10th Infantry Company at the battle of Selz along the Italian/Austro-Hungarian frontier in northeastern Italy during the 2nd Isonzo Offensive. Tagliamonte was killed during the

at Rapallo and Peschiera (5 and 8 November 1917) to discuss the military emergency in Italy. Among the many decisions that were taken, including the replacement of Cadorna with Armando Diaz (1861-1928) as the new Italian chief of staff, was the establishment of the new frontline along the Piave River. The British and the French believed that the Mincio would be easier to defend, but Victor Emanuel supported Diaz's decision to stand firm on the Piave in order to prevent the fall of Venice. Italian historiography has emphasised the king's role at Peschiera, stressing that Victor Emmanuel's calm impressed the British prime minister and reassured the Allies about Italy's determination to fight to the end. When victory came in November 1918, Victor Emmanuel III was saluted by Diaz as the Duce Supremo who had led the nation through three years of grave sacrifices and had managed to fulfil his ancestors' mission: completing the unification of Italy. The First World War strengthened the Savoy's prestige but economic decline and a chronic political crisis favoured the rise of paramilitary formations that threatened the liberal institutions. The threat of a social revolution in the wake of the events that occurred in Russia in 1917 caused major concern in Rome. Italian public opinion was further irritated by the disappointing outcome of the Versailles Peace Treaty. The myth of the ""mutilated victory"" quickly spread across Italy. Victor Emmanuel III looked favourably to Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) as the man who could guarantee stabilisation and restore order. On 30 October 1922 Mussolini was appointed prime minister.

Savoy, Victor Emmanuel Ferdinando Maria Gennaro (Savoia) Italian monarch Born 11 November 1869 in Naples, Italy Died 28 December 1947 in Alexandria, Egypt Summary Victor Emmanuel III played an important, if often overlooked part in Italy's decision to intervene in World War I on the side of the Entente. During the war, he managed to solve two political crises and to defend Italy's position within the Entente after the Caporetto disaster. Table of contents Victor Emmanuel (1869-1947) was the only child of Umberto I, King of Italy (1844-1900). On 29 July 1900, at age thirty, Victor Emmanuel ascended the throne following his father's assassination. His early years showed evidence that, by the standards of the Savoy monarchy, he was a man committed to constitutional government. Victor Emmanuel played an important role in military affairs and foreign politics. He supported Giovanni Giolitti (1842-1928) campaign in Libya in 1911 and, despite reassuring Berlin and Vienna of Rome's commitment to their Triple Alliance, he promoted a gradual reconciliation with the powers of the Triple Entente. The Italian monarch had a personal antipathy for Wilhelm II, German Emperor (1859-1941); he did not trust the Austrians either, feeling treated more

was finally declared on 23 May 1915. At the outbreak of hostilities, the king was constantly close to the frontline. He established his headquarters at Villa Linussa (later renamed Villa Italia) in Torreano di Martignacco, near Udine, where the Italian army's Comando Supremo was located. Every morning, he left for the front with a small escort of aides and visited both the trenches and the villages behind the front, demonstrating considerable courage in the face of enemy gunfire. He often visited the Comando Supremo as well, giving his advice to the Italian generals that he chanced to meet, but without overstepping the authority of Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna (1850-1928). After Salandra's fall, following the Austrian offensive in the Trentino (15 May-27 June 1916) Victor Emmanuel dealt with the political crisis with calm and determination. He appointed Paolo Boselli (1838-1932), aged seventy-eight, as the new prime minister, despite the disapproval of many who called for a more energetic figure. The king believed that an old patriot and experienced politician like Boselli was the right man to rally the Italian ruling class. Boselli formed a larger government along the lines of the French Union Sacree, which included some transformist socialists. The king's role became even more important after the defeat at Caporetto (24 October-12 November 1917). With the enemy on Italian soil, the Boselli government collapsed. The king called Vittorio Emanuele Orlando (1860-1952) to form a new cabinet. Orlando, who had been Boselli's interior minister and a fervent interventionist, maintained control over the Interior Ministry as well as the premiership. Orlando and Victor Emmanuel met with the British and French prime ministers, David Lloyd George (1863-1945) and Paul Painleve (1863-1933), at Rapallo and Peschiera (5 and 8 November 1917) to discuss the military emergency in Italy.

Lang of Chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the Davidson backyard shed. Years later, the company moved the original shed to the Juneau Avenue factory where it stood for many decades as a tribute. In 1906, Harley and the Davidson brothers built their first factory on Chestnut Street (later Juneau Avenue), at the current location of Harley-Davidson's corporate headquarters. The first Ju

The Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Factory Building was the original Harley-Davidson motorcycle factory constructed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1906. The factory was located at what is now 3700 W. Juneau and it was regularly expanded with additions in the early 1900s. It was added to National Register of Historic Places on November 9, 1994. == Background == Harley-Davidson's first location was a backyard shed where William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson built three motorcycles in 1903. Arthur Davidson's father was a cabinet maker and he constructed the shed in the Davidson backyard: it was 10 ft × 15 ft (3.0 m × 4.6 m). In 1904 the shed size was doubled with an addition and the fledgling company produced 8 motorcycles. In 1905 the shed size was doubled again with another addition. By the end of 1905 Harley and Davidson applied for and received a loan to build a factory. They purchased land at what is now Juneau Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and began constructing the 1906 Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Factory Building. In 1906, Harley and the Davidson brothers built their first factory on Chestnut Street (later Juneau Avenue). The first Juneau Avenue plant was 28 ft × 80 ft (8.5 m × 24.4 m). == Design == The original factory was at the current location of Harley-Davidson's corporate headquarters. In 1906 the company produced 50 machines in their new factory. The building was continually expanded to meet the demand with construction occurring often. The company also rented factory space in other Milwaukee locations. The demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles was growing each year: In 1909 they produced 1,149, motorcycles, in 1911 5,625, in 1912 3,852, in 1913 12,966. Motorcycles were produced at the original location from 1903 to 1973. By 1909 the machine shop occupied 5,760 sq ft (535 m2). The building was considered modern in 1909 but by 1913 it was inadequate based on the increased demand for Harley-Davidsons. The company razed the structure from April 17 to 23, 1913,",5,1,5,4
7,where did francisco coronado come from?,Spain,Salamanca,"Table of Contents The 16th-century Spanish explorer Francisco Vazquez de Coronado (c. 1510-1554) was serving as governor of an important province in New Spain (Mexico) when he heard reports of the so-called Seven Golden Cities located to the north. In 1540, Coronado led a major Spanish expedition up Mexico's western coast and into the region that is now the southwestern United States. Though the explorers found none of the storied treasure, they did discover the Grand Canyon and other major physical landmarks of the region, and clashed violently with local Indians. With his expedition labeled a failure by Spanish colonial authorities, Coronado returned to Mexico, where he died in 1554. Francisco Vazquez de Coronado's Early Life and Career Born circa 1510 into a noble family in Salamanca, Spain, Coronado was a younger son, and as such did not stand to inherit the family title or estate. As such, he decided to seek his fortune in the New World. In 1535, he traveled to New Spain (as Mexico was then known) with Antonio de Mendoza, the Spanish viceroy, whom his family had ties with from his father's service as royal administrator in Granada. Did you know? A string of Indian settlements built near what is now west-central New Mexico (near the Arizona border) by the Zuni Pueblo tribes inspired tales of the Seven Golden Cities of Cibola, the mythic empire of riches that Francisco Vazquez de Coronado was seeking in his expedition of 1540-42. Within a year after his arrival, Coronado married Beatriz, the young daughter of Alonso de Estrada, former colonial treasurer. The match earned him one of the largest estates in New Spain. In 1537, Coronado gained Mendoza's approval by successfully putting down rebellions by black slaves and Indians working in the mines. The following year, he was appointed as governor of the province of Nueva Galicia, a region that comprised much of what became the Mexican states of Jalisco, Nayarit and Sinaloa. History Lists: Explorers Not Named

Francisco Vázquez de Coronado (Spanish pronunciation: [fɾanˈθisko ˈβaθkeθ ðe koɾoˈnaðo]; 1510 – 22 September 1554) was a Spanish conquistador and explorer who led a large expedition from what is now Mexico to present-day Kansas through parts of the southwestern United States between 1540 and 1542. Vázquez de Coronado had hoped to reach the Cities of Cíbola, often referred to now as the mythical Seven Cities of Gold. His expedition marked the first European sightings of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River, among other landmarks. His name is often Anglicized as Vasquez de Coronado or just Coronado. == Early life == Vázquez de Coronado was born into a noble family in Salamanca, Spain, in 1510 as the second son of Juan Vázquez de Coronado and Isabel de Luján. Juan Vázquez held various positions in the administration of the recently captured Emirate of Granada under Íñigo López de Mendoza, its first Christian governor. Francisco Vázquez de Coronado went to New Spain (present-day Mexico) in 1535 at about age 25, in the entourage of its first Viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, the son of his father's patron and Vázquez de Coronado's personal friend. In New Spain, he married twelve-year-old Beatriz de Estrada, called ""the Saint"" (la Santa), sister of Leonor de Estrada, ancestor of the de Alvarado family and daughter of Treasurer and Governor Alonso de Estrada y Hidalgo, Lord of Picón, and his wife Marina Flores Gutiérrez de la Caballería, from a converso Jewish family. Vázquez de Coronado inherited a large portion of a Mexican encomendero estate through Beatriz and had eight children by her. == Expedition == === Preparation === Vázquez de Coronado was the Governor of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia (New Galicia), a province of New Spain located northwest of Mexico and comprising the contemporary Mexican states of Jalisco, Sinaloa and Nayarit. In 1539, he dispatched Friar Marcos de Niza and Estevanico (more properly known as Estevan), one of only four survivors of the Narváez

Alerts In Effect Contact Us Francisco Vazquez de Coronado Among the many who joined and traveled with the Coronado Expedition, the entrada's namesake and leader is the most well known. However, the Captain General of the expedition that would bear his name was only a cog in the wheel of a much larger force. Huge numbers of enslaved people, Aztec/Mexica allies, servants, herders, tailors, cobblers, cooks, European soldiers, journeymen, and many others streamed into the indigenous villages of northern Mexico, the Southwest US, and the plains of the Midwest. The collective impact the group had on the region is palpable, even with the buffer of historical perspective. Regardless, Francisco Vazquez de Coronado was the designated leader of the expedition and with this responsibility came decisions that would effect the outcome of the entrada. Therefore, it is important to know the man who took the helm of this expedition into the northern reaches of contemporary Nueva Espana. Francisco Vazquez de Coronado y Lujan was born to a noble family in Salamanca, Spain. His early history is somewhat uncertain, but he was thought to have been born in 1510. In 1535, Vazquez de Coronado - later to be referred to in English as Coronado - left Spain for Mesoamerica. He traveled with the entourage for Antonio de Mendoza, the new Viceroy, or governor, of New Spain. Vazquez de Coronado acquired an enormous estate from his marriage to Dona Beatiz, the daughter of colonial treasurer Alonso de Estrada, and was governor of Nueva Galicia by 1538. Despite his great fortune and status in Mexico, Vazquez de Coronado wanted to follow in the footsteps of other Spanish conquistadores, such as Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizarro Gonzalez, both of whom conquered large civilizations (Aztec and Incan empires respectively). When the Franciscan Priest, fray Marcos de Niza, returned from the north (what is now northern New Mexico) with tales of a vast empire, Viceroy Mendoza began assembling an expedition

Tertiary menu Texas Originals Francisco Vazquez de Coronado Francisco Vazquez de Coronado led the first Spanish expedition into the Great Plains. Embarking in 1540, the expedition traveled to the New Mexican pueblos, searching for the golden cities of Cibola reported by fellow explorer Fray Marcos de Niza. However, as Coronado wrote, ""Everything the friar had said was found to be the opposite."" Instead of finding another metropolis like Tenochtitlan, the Spaniards encountered only modest farming villages. Native guides then regaled the explorers with tales of the city of Quivira further inland in modern-day Kansas. The Spaniards set off across the vast, flat grasslands of the Llano Estacado and into the Great Plains to find riches but again came away disappointed. After more than two years away, Coronado returned to Mexico. He and his companions were the first Europeans to see massive herds of American bison, Palo Duro Canyon, and the land that is now the Texas Panhandle. As one historian put it, his expedition was ""one of the most remarkable ... recorded in the annals of American history."" Coronado ""added to the world as known to Europeans an [enormous] extent of country."" Nevertheless, Coronado and others viewed the expedition as a failure. He resumed his position as councilman in Mexico City and died in 1554. Spaniards would return to New Mexico soon enough but would not complete their conquest of Texas for another century. For More about Francisco Vazquez de Coronado The Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin offers an on-line exploration of the iconic expeditions that first brought Europeans within the borders of Texas, from Cabeza de Vaca and Francisco Coronado to Luis de Moscoso and Juan de Onate.

year, he was appointed as governor of the province of Nueva Galicia, a region that comprised much of what became the Mexican states of Jalisco, Nayarit and Sinaloa. History Lists: Explorers Not Named Columbus De Coronado's Search for the Seven Golden Cities By 1540, reports brought back from explorations made by Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and confirmed by missionary Fray Marcos de Niza convinced Mendoza of the presence of vast riches to the north, located in the so-called Seven Golden Cities of Cibola. Excited by the prospect of such immense wealth, Coronado joined Mendoza as an investor in a major expedition, which he himself would lead, of some 300 Spaniards and more than 1,000 Native Americans, along with many horses, pigs, ships and cattle. The main thrust of the expedition departed in February 1540 from Compostela, the capital of Nueva Galicia. Four arduous months later, Coronado led an advance group of cavalrymen to the first city of Cibola, which in reality was the Zuni Pueblo town of Hawikuh, located in what would become New Mexico. When the Indians resisted Spanish efforts to subdue the town, the better-armed Spaniards forced their way in and caused the Zunis to flee; Coronado was hit by a stone and wounded during the battle. Finding no riches, Coronado's men set out on further explorations of the region. During one of these smaller expeditions, Garcia Lopez de Cardenas became the first European to sight the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River in what is now Arizona. Another group, led by Pedro de Tovar, traveled to the Colorado Plateau. Failure of Expedition and Coronado's Return to Mexico Coronado's reunited expedition spent the winter of 1540-41 on the Rio Grande at Kuana (near modern-day Santa Fe). They fought off several Indian attacks, and in the spring of 1541 moved into Palo Duro Canyon, in modern-day Texas. Coronado himself then led a smaller group north in search of another rumored store of riches at Quivira (now Kansas), only to be disappointed",1,1,5,5
8,what was the ancient chinese writing system?,Oracle Bone Script,Sino-Tibetan languages,"Chinese writing, basically logographic writing system, one of the world's great writing systems. Like Semitic writing in the West, Chinese script was fundamental to the writing systems in the East. Until relatively recently, Chinese writing was more widely in use than alphabetic writing systems, and until the 18th century more than half of the world's books were written in Chinese, including works of speculative thought, historical writings of a kind, and novels, along with writings on government and law. History It is not known when Chinese writing originated, but it apparently began to develop in the early 2nd millennium bc. The earliest known inscriptions, each of which contains between 10 and 60 characters incised on pieces of bone and tortoiseshell that were used for oracular divination, date from the Shang (or Yin) dynasty (18th-12th century bc), but, by then it was already a highly developed system, essentially similar to its present form. By 1400 bc the script included some 2,500 to 3,000 characters, most of which can be read to this day. Later stages in the development of Chinese writing include the guwen (""ancient figures"") found in inscriptions from the late Shang dynasty (c. 1123 bc) and the early years of the Zhou dynasty that followed. The major script of the Zhou dynasty, which ruled from 1046 to 256 bc, was the dazhuan (""great seal""), also called the Zhou wen (""Zhou script""). By the end of the Zhou dynasty the dazhuan had degenerated to some extent. The script was fixed in its present form during the Qin period (221-207 bc). The earliest graphs were schematic pictures of what they represented; the graph for man resembled a standing figure, that for woman depicted a kneeling figure. Because basic characters or graphs were ""motivated""--that is, the graph was made to resemble the object it represented--it was once thought that Chinese writing is ideographic, representing ideas rather than the structures of a language. It is now recognized that the

Written Chinese is a writing system that uses Chinese characters and other symbols to represent the Chinese languages. Chinese characters do not directly represent pronunciation, unlike letters in an alphabet or syllabograms in a syllabary. Rather, the writing system is morphosyllabic: characters are one spoken syllable in length, but generally correspond to morphemes in the language, which may either be independent words, or part of a polysyllabic word. Most characters are constructed from smaller components that may reflect the character's meaning or pronunciation. Literacy requires the memorization of thousands of characters; college-educated Chinese speakers know approximately 4,000. This has led in part to the adoption of complementary transliteration systems (generally Pinyin) as a means of representing the pronunciation of Chinese. Chinese writing is first attested during the late Shang dynasty (c. 1250 – c. 1050 BCE), but the process of creating characters is thought to have begun centuries earlier during the Late Neolithic and early Bronze Age (c. 2500–2000 BCE). After a period of variation and evolution, Chinese characters were standardized under the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE). Over the millennia, these characters have evolved into well-developed styles of Chinese calligraphy. As the varieties of Chinese diverged, a situation of diglossia developed, with speakers of mutually unintelligible varieties able to communicate through writing using Literary Chinese. In the early 20th century, Literary Chinese was replaced in large part with written vernacular Chinese, largely corresponding to Standard Chinese, a form based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. Although most other varieties of Chinese are not written, there are traditions of written Cantonese, written Shanghainese and written Hokkien, among others. == Structure == Written Chinese is not based on an alphabet or syllabary. Most characters can be analyzed as compounds of smaller components, which may be

A Brief History of Chinese Characters An Introduction to the Evolution of Chinese Characters When you learn to read and write Chinese you are learning one of the world's oldest writing systems. The evolution of Chinese characters can be traced back thousands of years. Signs and symbols engraved on pottery, shells and bones have been unearthed from 8,000 years ago. A uniformed writing system developed about 3,000 years ago with divination rites inscribed on animal bones and turtle shells. Some of those characters are 'ancestors' to Chinese characters used today. Chinese writing continued to evolve over the centuries, and by the early Tang Dynasty (618-690AD) we have the recognisable system of today's Traditional Chinese writing. One further evolution in the history of Chinese writing occurred last century with the simplification of Chinese characters to create the writing system currently used in mainland China. What are Chinese characters? Chinese characters, known as Hanzi (Yi Zi ), form the basis of Chinese writing and differ markedly from the alphabet system used in Western languages. Unlike letters of the alphabet, logograms represent words or compounds of words. All the world's oldest writing systems, such as those used in Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and China, use a logographic system. The earliest Chinese characters were created using pictures or pictographs, which were originally inscribed on clay pottery and bone and then later on bronze and other metals. These characters eventually developed into the calligraphic style that we see today; this style has also been altered through the ages from the crude, unformulated style of the so-called Oracle bones to the modern day 'rhombus-shape' characters. Some characters are pictograms where the character is a picture depicting the item. Others are ideograms representing an abstract concept (such as 'up' and 'down'). Then there are characters that combine two or more pictograms and ideograms to create a new meaning,

was made to resemble the object it represented--it was once thought that Chinese writing is ideographic, representing ideas rather than the structures of a language. It is now recognized that the system represents the Chinese language by means of a logographic script. Each graph or character corresponds to one meaningful unit of the language, not directly to a unit of thought. Although it was possible to make up simple signs to represent common objects, many words were not readily picturable. To represent such words the phonographic principle was adopted. A graph that pictured some object was borrowed to write a different word that happened to sound similar. With this invention the Chinese approached the form of writing invented by the Sumerians. However, because of the enormous number of Chinese words that sound the same, to have carried through the phonographic principle would have resulted in a writing system in which many of the words could be read in more than one way. That is, a written character would be extremely ambiguous. The solution to the problem of character ambiguity, adopted about 213 bc (during the reign of the first Qin emperor, Shihuangdi), was to distinguish two words having the same sound and represented by the same graph by adding another graph to give a clue to the meaning of the particular word intended. Such complex graphs or characters consist of two parts, one part suggesting the sound, the other part the meaning. The system was then standardized so as to approach the ideal of one distinctive graph representing each morpheme, or unit of meaning, in the language. The limitation is that a language that has thousands of morphemes would require thousands of characters, and, as the characters are formed from simple lines in various orientations and arrangements, they came to possess great complexity. Not only did the principle of the script change with time, so too did the form of the graphs. The earliest writing consisted of carved

Ancient Chinese Writing evolved from the practice of divination during the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE). Some theories suggest that images and markings on pottery shards found at Ban Po Village are evidence of an early writing system but this claim has been challenged repeatedly. Ban Po was occupied c. 4500-3750 BCE and was discovered by workmen digging a foundation for a factory in 1953 CE. Ceramic shards uncovered at the site have been classified into 27 distinct categories of image/sign which suggest to some scholars an early language. The opposing view is that these images are simply marks of ownership, comparable to making an X on a document to sign one's name, and cannot be considered an actual written language. The majority of recent scholarship agrees that writing evolved during the Shang Dynasty and developed from there. Scholar Patricia Buckley Ebrey expresses the consensus on this: Exactly when writing was first used in China is not known since most writing would have been done on perishable materials like wood, bamboo, or silk. Symbols or emblems inscribed on late neolithic pots may be early forms of Chinese graphs. Early Shang bronzes sometimes have similar symbols cast into them. The earliest evidence of full sentences is found on the oracle bones of the late Shang. From these divinatory inscriptions, there can be no doubt that the Shang used a language directly ancestral to modern Chinese and moreover used a written script that evolved into the standard Chinese logographic writing system still in use today. (26-27) Once writing was developed by the Chinese it had a significant impact on the culture. Ebrey writes, ""In China, as elsewhere, writing once adopted has profound effects on social and cultural processes(26)."" The bureaucracy of China came to rely on written records and, culturally, expression of personal thoughts and feelings was made possible through poetry and prose, creating some of the greatest literature in the world.

Thomas Hobbes was an English philosopher, scientist, and historian best known for his political philosophy, especially as articulated in his masterpiece Leviathan (1651). His enduring contribution was as a political philosopher who justified wide-ranging government powers on the basis of the self-interested consent of citizens. In Hobbes's social contract, the many trade liberty for safety. What was Thomas Hobbes's childhood like? Hobbes's father was a quick-tempered vicar who, disgraced after engaging in a brawl at his own church door, disappeared, abandoning his three children to the care of his brother, a glover. When Hobbes was 4, he was sent to school at Westport, Wiltshire, then to a private school, and, at 15, to Magdalen Hall, Oxford. What did Thomas Hobbes do for a living? For nearly the whole of his adult life, Thomas Hobbes was employed by members of the wealthy and aristocratic Cavendish family and their associates as tutor, translator, traveling companion, keeper of accounts, business representative, political adviser, and scientific collaborator. How did Thomas Hobbes influence others? Thomas Hobbes's political philosophy influenced not only successors who adopted the social-contract framework--John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant, for example--but also less directly those theorists who connected moral and political decision making in rational human beings to considerations of self-interest broadly understood. Thomas Hobbes (born April 5, 1588, Westport, Wiltshire, England--died December 4, 1679, Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire) was an English philosopher, scientist, and historian, best known for his political philosophy, especially as articulated in his masterpiece Leviathan (1651).

Thomas Hobbes Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), whose current reputation rests largely on his political philosophy, was a thinker with wide-ranging interests. In philosophy, he defended a range of materialist, nominalist, and empiricist views against Cartesian and Aristotelian alternatives. In physics, his work was influential on Leibniz, and led him into disputes with Boyle and the experimentalists of the early Royal Society. In history, he translated Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War into English, and later wrote his own history of the Long Parliament. In mathematics he was less successful, and is best remembered for his repeated unsuccessful attempts to square the circle. But despite that, Hobbes was a serious and prominent participant in the intellectual life of his time. Thomas Hobbes was born on 5 April 1588. His home town was Malmesbury, which is in Wiltshire, England, about 30 miles east of Bristol. Very little is known about Hobbes's mother. His father, also called Thomas Hobbes, was a somewhat disreputable local clergyman. Hobbes's seventeenth-century biographer John Aubrey tells the story of how ""The old vicar Hobs was a good fellow and had been at cards Saturday all night, and at church in his sleep he cries out 'Trafells is troumps'"" [i.e., clubs are trumps] (Aubrey 1696, 1.387). The older Thomas Hobbes eventually (in 1604) left Malmesbury, when a dispute with another clergyman, Richard Jeane, escalated to the point of a fight in a churchyard. In Aubrey's words: ""Hobs stroke him and was forced to fly for it"" (Aubrey 1696, 1.387). By that point the future philosopher Hobbes had himself left Malmesbury (in 1602 or 1603), in order to study at Magdalene Hall, Oxford. His studies there were supported by his uncle, Francis Hobbes, who was a glover. After graduating from Oxford in February 1608, Hobbes went to work for the Cavendish family, initially as a tutor to William Cavendish (1590-1628), who later became the second earl of Devonshire. Hobbes would

Political authority is justified by a hypotheticalsocial contract among the many that vests in a sovereign person or entity the responsibility for the safety and well-being of all. In metaphysics, Hobbes defended materialism, the view that only material things are real. His scientific writings present all observed phenomena as the effects of matter in motion. Hobbes was not only a scientist in his own right but a great systematizer of the scientific findings of his contemporaries, including Galileo and Johannes Kepler. His enduring contribution is as a political philosopher who justified wide-ranging government powers on the basis of the self-interested consent of citizens. Early life Who was philosopher Thomas Hobbes?Questions and answers about Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes's father was a quick-tempered vicar of a small Wiltshire parish church. Disgraced after engaging in a brawl at his own church door, he disappeared and abandoned his three children to the care of his brother, a well-to-do glover in Malmesbury. When he was four years old, Hobbes was sent to school at Westport, then to a private school, and finally, at 15, to Magdalen Hall in the University of Oxford, where he took a traditional arts degree and in his spare time developed an interest in maps. For nearly the whole of his adult life, Hobbes worked for different branches of the wealthy and aristocratic Cavendish family. Upon taking his degree at Oxford in 1608, he was employed as page and tutor to the young William Cavendish, afterward the second earl of Devonshire. Over the course of many decades Hobbes served the family and their associates as translator, traveling companion, keeper of accounts, business representative, political adviser, and scientific collaborator. Through his employment by William Cavendish, the first earl of Devonshire, and his heirs, Hobbes became connected with the royalist side in disputes between the king and Parliament that continued

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) was an English philosopher who famously summarised his pessimistic view of human nature in his greatest work, Leviathan, published in 1651. Hobbes believed that the life of humanity in the state of nature is short and brutish, a situation that can be mitigated by people coming together and handing over some of their liberty to a strong political authority, which will act in their best interests. Early Life Thomas Hobbes was born on 5 April 1588 in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, England. Hobbes was ""fond of the joke that his mother fell into labour with him on hearing the rumour of the Spanish Armada coming, 'so that fear and I were born twins together'"" (Blackburn, 222). Although his family was not rich, Thomas did very well at school, particularly in languages and poetry. Thanks to funding from a wealthy uncle, Hobbes then studied at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford between 1602 and 1608. Hobbes began to gather important connections when, in 1608, he started working for the statesman William Cavendish (1555-1626) as a secretary. He also had time to work on translations, notably producing an English translation of Thucydides' Peloponnesian War in 1629. The long-term relationship with the Cavendish family continued into the 1630s when Hobbes tutored Cavendish's son William, Earl of Devonshire (1617-1684), while travelling through France and Italy on several grand tours. In between, Hobbes had also worked as a secretary for the influential courtier and author Francis Bacon (1561-1626) in the 1620s. Hobbes was certainly keen to meet influential people in person. He met the famed astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) and the French philosopher Rene Descartes (1596-1650). Hobbes' connections only became more impressive over time. By 1646, he was working as the mathematics tutor to Prince Charles, future Charles II of England (r. 1660-1685). Hobbes kept this post for three years. The prince described Hobbes as ""the oddest fellow he'd ever

The governor has a duty to enforce state laws and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Florida Legislature, to convene the legislature and grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment. When Florida was first acquired by the United States, future president Andrew Jackson served as its military governor. Florida Territory was established in 1822 and five people served as governor over 6 distinct terms. The first territorial governor, William Pope Duval, served 12 years, the longest of any Florida governor to date. Since statehood in 1845, there have been 45 people who have served as governor, one of whom served two distinct terms. Four state governors have served two full four-year terms: William D.

The lieutenant governor of Florida is a statewide constitutional office in the executive branch of the U.S. state of Florida. It is the second highest-ranking official in the state government. The lieutenant governor is elected on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Official duties dictated to the lieutenant governor under the present Florida Constitution are to serve as the acting governor in the absence of the governor from the state or the disability of the governor, or to become governor in the event of the governor's death, resignation or removal from office via impeachment. Jeanette Nuñez is the 20th and current lieutenant governor of Florida, in office since January 2019 under Ron DeSantis. == History == The position of lieutenant governor has been used in Florida's government twice in the state's history. The first period spanned from 1865, after the American Civil War, through 1889. During this time, the lieutenant governor was elected independently of the governor. In addition to being first in succession to the governor, the lieutenant governor was the ex officio president of the Florida Senate, and could cast a vote in the case of a tie. William W. J. Kelly was the first person elected lieutenant governor after the position was created by the 1865 Constitution of Florida. The position was officially abolished by the post-Reconstruction Constitution of 1885, with the last lieutenant governor, Milton H. Mabry, serving out his term until 1889. After this point the office of President of the Senate was given to an elected member of the Senate, who also served as first in line of succession to the governor. The current Florida Constitution of 1968 recreated the office of lieutenant governor who is now elected directly along with the governor as a running mate. The lieutenant governor serves as first in the line of succession, but the office of President of the Senate remains with an elected senator. The lieutenant governor has a few prescribed

Florida Governors Beginning with Governor Francis Fleming in the 1890s, every chief executive of Florida has had an official portrait painted and hung in the state capitol building. Over the years, an interesting variety of artistic styles has accumulated. In the mid-1950s, the state legislature commissioned Tallahassee artist Clarabel Jett (1908-96) to create oil-enhanced photographs of all Florida governors whose portraits were not yet in the state collection. In 1986, the legislature transferred custody of the portrait collection to the Museum of Florida History. All of the Governors' portraits are represented at the Historic Capitol. The more recent governors' portraits appear in the first-floor hallway of the new Capitol, beginning with Claude Kirk (1967-1971). In keeping with the tradition of official governors' portraits, our current governor, Ron DeSantis, will not commission his portrait until the end of his term. These are colorful portraits of colorful people, all of whom have been Florida history makers. Under Florida law, e-mail addresses are public records.

He inspired millions of people and brought attention to martial arts in the Western world. He was born Lee Jun-fan on 27 November 1940, in San Francisco, California, while his opera singer father was touring the United States. He returned with his parents to Hong Kong as an infant and worked as a child actor. At age 13, he began learning martial arts. At age 18, he returned to the United States where he studied drama and philosophy and opened a martial arts school. At age 26, he first appeared as a martial arts fighter on American television. Lee created his own combat method that he called Jeet Kune Do or the Way of the Intercepting Fist, which combined different training methods such as kung fu, fencing, boxing and philosophy. He popularized philosophical quotes, such as the one starting 'Be water, my friend...' [1]. He returned to Hong Kong at the age of 29, where he became a writer, director, lead actor and fight scene choreographer. Lee died at the age of 32 in Hong Kong on 20 July 1973, under mysterious circumstances.

ABSTRACT Bruce Lee brought attention to martial arts in the Western world and popularized the quote 'Be water, my friend'. Lee died at the age of 32 years in Hong Kong on 20 July 1973, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of death is unknown, although numerous hypotheses have been proposed, from assassination by gangsters to the more recent suggestion in 2018 that he died from heatstroke. The necropsy showed cerebral oedema. A prior episode was diagnosed as cerebral oedema 2 months earlier. We now propose, based on an analysis of publicly available information, that the cause of death was cerebral oedema due to hyponatraemia. In other words, we propose that the kidney's inability to excrete excess water killed Bruce Lee. In this regard, Lee had multiple risk factors for hyponatraemia that may have included high chronic fluid intake, factors that acutely increase thirst (marijuana) and factors that decrease the ability of the kidneys to excrete water by either promoting secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or interfering with water excretion mechanisms in kidney tubules: prescription drugs (diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, antiepileptic drugs), alcohol, chronic low solute intake, a past history of acute kidney injury and exercise.

On the day of his death, he and the producer of his films, Raymond Chow, drove to the house of Betty Ting Pei, who was thought to be the mistress of Lee. Lee spent some hours alone with Ting Pei and used marijuana before driving to the house, and while there Lee actively acted out some scenes of an upcoming movie. He experienced headache and dizziness around 7:30 pm, after drinking water. Ting Pei gave him an 'Equagesic' pill (a combination of meprobamate and aspirin which he had taken before) and Lee went to the bedroom to rest. Raymond Chow left at that time. At 9:30 pm, Ting Pei found Lee unconscious. She called Chow who went to the house and tried to wake Lee up without success. They called a doctor, who spent another 10 min unsuccessfully doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Lee was sent to the nearest hospital, where he was pronounced dead. At autopsy, there were no signs of external injuries and no tongue bite. Severe cerebral oedema had resulted in brain weight of 1575 g compared with the normal 1400 g [4]. Traces of marijuana were found in the stomach. Bruce Lee's death was officially ruled to be the result of cerebral oedema caused by hypersensitivity to Equagesic. Theories about the cause of death Among the multiple plausible and implausible causes of death, three merit discussion. Cerebral oedema caused by hypersensitivity to Equagesic [5]. Hypersensitivity to the components of Equagesic

Among the multiple plausible and implausible causes of death, three merit discussion. Cerebral oedema caused by hypersensitivity to Equagesic [5]. Hypersensitivity to the components of Equagesic (aspirin and meprobamate) was identified as the official cause of death [4]. However, Lee had taken this drug before [3] and on the day of his death, he took it AFTER he felt unwell, already having symptoms that may be explained by cerebral oedema (i.e. headache) and cerebral oedema would not be expected to be the only necropsy finding if indeed hypersensitivity to Equagesic was the cause of death. Epilepsy. A seizure was considered a potential cause of the 10 May 1973 episode described below, although as it was a sole episode, a diagnosis of epilepsy was not made. On 29 and 30 May 1973, Lee underwent a full neurologic evaluation: 'a complete physical, a brain flow study, and an electroencephalogram', reviewed by neurologist David Reisbord, who did not find abnormalities in his brain functions [3]. Nevertheless, phenytoin was prescribed and Lee was on phenytoin up to the day of his death. Martial artists are at high risk of head trauma or even microtrauma [6]. The most important direct epilepsy-related cause of death is a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is more common in patients with chronic epilepsy [7]. Forensic reports can include tongue bites (20-40%), cerebral oedema and pulmonary oedema [7, 8]. The fact that he had no chronic epilepsy, was on antiepileptic drug therapy and had no tongue bite in necropsy argue against this diagnosis. Heatstroke. This latest hypothesis about the cause of death was proposed by Matthew Polly in his 2018 book Bruce Lee, A Life [3]. Heatstroke refers to when body core temperature increases above 40degC, associated with hot dry skin and central nervous system abnormalities [9]. In 2014, the Japanese Association of Acute Medicine (JAAM), published criteria for heat-related illnesses, including heatstroke. A 2016 JAAM Heat

the development of worsening hyponatraemia with altered mental status [36]. Pre-existing hyponatraemia was found in over 70% of all patients admitted with symptomatic hyponatraemia and represented the most common risk factor identified. Additionally, in patients with a baseline risk of hyponatraemia due to other factors, an increase in the number of prescription drugs that predispose to hyponatraemia synergistically increases the risk of hyponatraemia (Figure 2) [31]. Thus, even if some of the risk factors identified in the present report were not actually present or had a mild influence by themselves, the presence of multiple risk factors may explain the sequence of events that led to Lee's demise. FIGURE 2: Prescription drugs and risk for hyponatraemia. A higher number of prescription drugs associated with hyponatraemia further increases the risk of hyponatraemia in patients with other predisposing factors. Bar graph built using data from reference [31]. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we hypothesize that Bruce Lee died from a specific form of kidney dysfunction: the inability to excrete enough water to maintain water homeostasis, which is mainly a tubular function. This may lead to hyponatraemia, cerebral oedema and death within hours if excess water intake is not matched by water excretion in urine, which is in line with the timeline of Lee's demise. Given that hyponatraemia is frequent, as is found in up to 40% of hospitalized persons [37] and may cause death due to excessive water ingestion even in young healthy persons, there is a need for a wider dissemination of the concept that excessive water intake can kill. The fact that we are 60% [38] water does not protect us from the potentially lethal consequences of drinking water at a faster rate than our kidneys can excrete excess water. Ironically, Lee made famous the quote 'Be water my friend', but excess water appears to have ultimately killed him. CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT A.O. has received grants from",1,1,1,1
12,what type of government did mexico have?,dictatorship,Federal republic,"Type: Federal republic. Independence: First proclaimed September 16, 1810; republic established 1824. Constitution: February 5, 1917. Branches: Executive--president (chief of state and head of government). Legislative--bicameral. Judicial--Supreme Court, local and federal systems. Political parties: Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), National Action Party (PAN), Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), Labor Party (PT), and several small parties. Suffrage: Universal at 18. Administrative subdivisions: 31 states and a federal district. Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world and the second-most populous country in Latin America after Portuguese-speaking Brazil. About 70% of the people live in urban areas. Many Mexicans emigrate from rural areas that lack job opportunities--such as the underdeveloped southern states and the crowded central plateau--to the industrialized urban centers and the developing areas along the U.S.-Mexico border. According to some estimates, the population of the area around Mexico City is about 20 million, which would make it the largest concentration of population in the world. Cities bordering on the United States, such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, and cities in the interior, such as Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Puebla, have undergone sharp rises in population. GOVERNMENT The 1917 constitution provides for a federal republic with powers separated into independent executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In practice, the executive is the dominant branch, with power vested in the president, who promulgates and executes the laws of the Congress. The president also legislates by executive decree in certain economic and financial fields, using powers delegated from the Congress. The president is elected by universal adult suffrage for a six-year term and may not hold office a second time. There is no vice president; in the event of the removal or death of the president, a provisional president is elected by

Constitutional framework Mexico is a federal republic composed of 31 states and the Federal District. Governmental powers are divided constitutionally between executive, legislative, and judicial branches, but, when Mexico was under one-party rule in the 20th century, the president had strong control over the entire system. The constitution of 1917, which has been amended several times, guarantees personal freedoms and civil liberties and also establishes economic and political principles for the country. The legislative branch is divided into an upper house, the Senate, and a lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. Senators serve six-year terms and deputies three-year terms; members of the legislature cannot be reelected for the immediately succeeding term. Three-fifths of the deputies are elected directly by popular vote, while the remainder are selected in proportion to the votes received by political parties in each of five large electoral regions. Popularly elected and limited to one six-year term, the president is empowered to select a cabinet, the attorney general, diplomats, high-ranking military officers, and Supreme Court justices (who serve life terms). The president also has the right to issue reglamentos (executive decrees) that have the effect of law. Because there is no vice president, in the event of the death or incapacity of the president, the legislature designates a provisional successor. The executive branch has historically dominated the other two branches of government, although the Congress has gained a larger share of power since the late 20th century. Local government The federal constitution relegates several powers to the 31 states and the Federal District (Mexico City), including the ability to raise local taxes. Moreover, state constitutions follow the model of the federal constitution in providing for three independent branches of government--legislative, executive, and judicial. Most states have a unicameral legislature called the

follow the model of the federal constitution in providing for three independent branches of government--legislative, executive, and judicial. Most states have a unicameral legislature called the Chamber of Deputies, whose members serve three-year terms. Governors are popularly elected to six-year terms and may not be reelected. Because of Mexico's tradition of highly centralized government, state and local budgets are largely dependent on federally allocated funds. Under PRI rule, Mexican presidents influenced or decided many state and local matters, including elections. Although such centralized control is no longer generally accepted, Mexico's principal political parties maintain locally dominant power bases in various states and cities. At its most basic level, local government is administered by more than 2,000 units called municipios (""municipalities""), which may be entirely urban or consist of a town or central village as well as its hinterland. Members of municipio governments are typically elected for three-year terms. Justice The judicial system consists of several courts, including the Supreme Court of Justice, whose 11 members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Congress; the Electoral Tribunal, which is sworn to oversee elections; the Federal Judicial Council; and numerous circuit and district courts. Although Mexico has both federal and state courts, most serious cases are heard in federal courts by judges without the assistance of juries. According to law, defendants have several rights to assure fair trials and humane treatment; in practice, however, the system is overburdened and riddled with problems. In spite of determined efforts by some authorities to fight theft, fraud, and violent crime, few Mexicans have strong confidence in the police or the judicial system, and therefore a large percentage of crimes go unreported. On the other hand, poor and indigenous defendants suffer an inordinate share of arbitrary arrests and

federal, state, and local levels. However, there is a general perception that police and political corruption is endemic at all levels, with the mordida (""bite""), which can alternatively be seen as a bribe or as unofficial, informal payment for official service, remaining a mainstay. Mexico's armed forces include an air force, a navy with about one-fifth of the military's total personnel, and an army constituting nearly three-fourths of the total. Military service is mandatory at age 18 for a period of one year. The military has not openly interfered with elections or governance since the 1920s, in marked contrast with civil-military relations elsewhere in Latin America. Sometimes the military takes part in law enforcement, particularly in counternarcotics operations, and it has often focused its efforts on perceived threats to internal security, including groups suspected of insurgency or terrorism. For example, many military and police units were deployed in southern Mexico in the late 20th century to combat the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN; also called the Zapatistas), which launched an open rebellion in 1994 in Chiapas (and remained active more than a decade later). Although the government respects the human rights of most citizens, serious abuses of power have been reported as part of the security operations in southern Mexico and in the policing of indigenous communities and poor urban neighbourhoods.

in the police or the judicial system, and therefore a large percentage of crimes go unreported. On the other hand, poor and indigenous defendants suffer an inordinate share of arbitrary arrests and detentions, and many are held for long periods prior to trials or sentencing. Mexico's prisons, like most of those in Latin America, are generally overcrowded and notorious for unhealthful conditions, corruption, and abuses of various kinds. The vast majority of Mexican prisoners are held in hundreds of state and local facilities, although smaller numbers are in federal prisons. Political process Mexico's political system revolves around a limited number of large political parties, while on its fringes are a group of smaller parties. The most powerful political party in the 20th century was the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional; PRI), which ran Mexico as an effective one-party state from 1929 until the late 20th century. During this period the PRI never lost a presidential election--though often there were allegations of vote rigging--and the vast majority of its gubernatorial candidates were similarly successful. Typically, the sitting president, as leader of the party, selected its next presidential candidate--thus effectively choosing a successor. Ernesto Zedillo, the president from 1994 to 2000, broke from that tradition in 1999, prompting the PRI to hold a primary election to choose a candidate; Zedillo also instituted other electoral reforms. As a result, in 2000 the PRI's presidential candidate was defeated by Vicente Fox Quesada of the conservativeNational Action Party (Partido de Accion Popular; PAN), who led an opposition coalition, the ""Alliance for Change,"" to victory, marking the end of 71 years of continuous rule by the PRI. (The party had already lost control of the Chamber of Deputies in 1997.) The election, which was monitored by tens of thousands of Mexican and international observers, was considered to be the",1,1,1,4

Offscreen, Selena has also been a vocal supporter of her heritage, even using her platforms--including her Rare Beauty brand--to spread messages of unity during a time when our society has become greatly segregated. ""Hispanic Heritage Month is coming to an end, but I'm proud of my heritage every month,"" she wrote on Instagram in Oct. 2022. ""It breaks my heart to see so many instances where people use someone's background to divide, rather than celebrate what we each bring with our rich cultures and stories.

Guadalupe Ontiveros (née Moreno; September 17, 1942 – July 26, 2012) was an American actress best known for portraying Rosalita in The Goonies, and Yolanda Saldívar in the film Selena. She acted in numerous films and television shows. Ontiveros was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on Desperate Housewives and received critical acclaim for her role in Chuck & Buck, for which Ontiveros won the National Board of Review award for Best Supporting Actress, and was also nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. == Early life == Guadalupe Moreno was born on September 17, 1942, in El Paso, Texas, the daughter of Luz ""Lucita"" Castañón and Juan Moreno, middle-class Mexican immigrants who overcame a lack of formal education to become owners of a tortilla factory and two restaurants in El Paso. Lupe was raised Roman Catholic and graduated from El Paso High School and went on to study at Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas, where she received a bachelor's degree in social work in 1964. After marrying Elías Ontiveros in 1966, the couple moved to California to realize his dream of starting an automotive business. During a period of dissatisfaction with her career as a social worker, Ontiveros was trying to decide whether to go back to school for a nursing degree when she saw an article about a need for local film extras. With her husband's encouragement, Ontiveros took the job and parlayed it into a long stage and screen career. Prior to acting, she had worked for 18 years as a social worker, and Ontiveros continued as an activist with many of the same causes with which she worked in that profession, such as domestic violence prevention and AIDS awareness and prevention. == Career == === Film === Ontiveros once estimated that she had played a maid at least 150 times on stage and screen; Ontiveros wanted to see more diverse roles available to Latina actors, noting: ""I'm proud to represent those hands that labor in this country. I've given every maid I've ever portrayed

she accepted the role even before seeing the script, solely on the basis of being asked to play a character who was not defined by Hispanic ethnicity. For that role, Ontiveros was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture at the 2000 Independent Spirit Awards. During her acting career, Ontiveros participated in the web series Los Americans (2011), which is characterized by h

and screen; Ontiveros wanted to see more diverse roles available to Latina actors, noting: ""I'm proud to represent those hands that labor in this country. I've given every maid I've ever portrayed soul and heart."" In part because of her history in this role, Ontiveros was chosen as the narrator for the documentary Maid in America. One of her most prominent early film roles was in the 1983 Gregory Nava film El Norte, in which Ontiveros played a seamstress and maid who acts as mentor to a newly arrived immigrant girl from Guatemala. In a 2004 interview with the Dominican newspaper Listin Diario, Ontiveros called El Norte ""the film that always will remain in me... [it] tells the immigrants' story"" when asked to name her favorite film from her long career. Ontiveros played the housekeeper, Rosalita, a Spanish-speaking maid hired to assist in the packing and moving of the Walsh family in the hit adventure film The Goonies (1985) and a housekeeper in Dolly Dearest (1992). Ontiveros also had a notable cameo appearance in Blood In Blood Out (1993) as Carmen, a drug dealer who Paco (Benjamin Bratt) busts in a sting operation as an undercover cop pretending to be a drug dealer. Ontiveros worked with Nava in subsequent films, including My Family/Mi Familia (1995) and Selena (1997). In the latter film, she portrayed Yolanda Saldívar, the murderer of Tejano superstar Selena. Long after the film was released, Ontiveros would still reportedly be ""hissed"" at by Selena fans while in public. Ontiveros also appeared in the Academy Award-winning film As Good as It Gets. In 2000, Ontiveros was featured in the film Chuck & Buck, in which she played Beverly, a tough theater director who puts on a play written by one of the film's main characters. Ontiveros said in multiple interviews that she accepted the role even before seeing the script, solely on the basis of being asked to play a character who was not defined by Hispanic ethnicity. For that role, Ontiveros was nominated for Best

White Mexicans (Spanish: Mexicanos blancos) are individuals in Mexico who identify as white, often due to their physical appearance or their recognition of European or West Asian ancestry. The Mexican government conducts ethnic censuses that allow individuals to identify as ""White,"" but the specific results of these censuses are not made public. Instead, the government releases data on the percentage of ""light-skinned Mexicans"" in the country, with nationwide surveys conducted by the Mexico's National Institute of Statistics, the National Council to Prevent Discrimination and contemporary sources such as Encyclopædia Britannica reporting results that average 32%. The term ""Light-skinned Mexican"" is preferred by both the government and media to describe individuals in Mexico who possess European physical traits when discussing ethno-racial dynamics. However, ""White Mexican"" is still used at times. Estimates of Mexico's White population vary significantly due to the different methodologies used. Unofficial sources such as the World Factbook or Latinobarómetro, suggest a white population of just 10%. A 2005 study by a professor of the National Autonomous University of Mexico estimated said group at 15% using as base the results of the 1921 census which is admitted, may be inaccurate. Other historians have also questioned the accuracy of the 1921 census' results, with independent research in 2008 and 2010 also suggesting that Mexicans may not identify in the way the 1921 census indicate. Other sources suggest higher percentages: field surveys that use the presence of blond hair as a reference to classify a Mexican as White found that 23% of the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico population could be classified as such, the American Sociological Association obtained a nationwide percentage of 18.8% using the same method. Another study conducted by the University College London in collaboration with National Institute of Anthropology and History found that 18% of",1,1,5,1
14,what season did lana lang leave smallville?,5,Smallville - Season 8,"Lana Lang is a fictional character on the television series Smallville. She has been a series regular since the pilot episode, and has been played continuously by Kristin Kreuk, with two other actresses having portrayed Lana Lang as a child and as an elderly woman. The character of Lana Lang, first created for comic books by Bill Finger and John Sikela in the 1950s as a romantic interest for Superboy, was adapted to television in 2001 by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the Smallville television series, none of which directly continues from or into the television episodes. In Smallville, Lana is the first main love interest for Clark Kent, though, in the first season she is dating Whitney Fordman. By season two, with Whitney's departure, Lana and Clark begin to grow closer. Clark's dishonesty over the secrets he is hiding causes their relationship to end. Lana then grows closer to Lex Luthor, whom she marries and divorces in the sixth season. Eventually Lana learns the truth about Clark and they get back together. After stealing a kryptonite-powered suit from Lex, Lana absorbs an enormous amount of kryptonite radiation, which prohibits her from getting too close to Clark, and she leaves Smallville for good, but vowed to continue to use her powers to preserve life. Initially, Lana is characterized as the intelligent ""girl next door"". She eventually becomes a tragic figure in Smallville, as the decisions made by Clark and Lex change the character over the course of the show. As Gough explains, by the end of the sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own game. Over the course of the show, Lana transitions from the girl next door to a more ""self-reliant young woman"". Kreuk has been nominated for various awards for her portrayal of Lana Lang. == Role in Smallville == In the first season, Lana and Clark Kent (Tom Welling) are just beginning their friendship, as she is a popular cheerleader

In the pilot episode, when her parents are killed in the first meteor shower, Lana (Jade Unterman) is adopted by her aunt Nell (Sarah-Jane Redmond). As the first season progresses, Lana grows closer to Clark, while Whitney begins to distance himself because of his father's medical ailments. In season two's episode ""Heat"" Lana sends Whitney, who left Smallville for the Marines in the season one finale, a video message breaking up with him. Lana's aunt Nell moves to Metropolis with her fiancé in the season two episode ""Ryan"", but Lana opts to move in with her friend Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) so that she may finish high school in Smallville. By the end of season two, Lana and Clark slowly try and start a romantic relationship, but fear backlash from Chloe because of her personal feelings for Clark. Just as the two give in to their feelings fully, Clark unexpectedly runs away from Smallville in the season two finale. At the start of season three, it is shown that Lana, alongside the Kents, has been spending her time searching for Clark; she ultimately finds him in Metropolis thanks to Chloe's help. Clark's actions in Metropolis force the two to rethink their relationship in the season three episode ""Phoenix"", and Lana eventually begins a new relationship with Adam Knight (Ian Somerhalder), whom she met while in physical therapy after being trampled by a horse in season three's ""Asylum"".

Lana Lang is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Lana is a supporting character of Superman, a childhood friend and love interest of the young Clark Kent. She was created by writer Bill Finger and artist John Sikela, and first appeared in Superboy #10 (September/October 1950). The character has occasionally gained superhuman powers and assumes the superhero identities of Insect Queen and Superwoman. Lana has appeared in other-media adaptations of Superman, typically as a teenager. These portrayals include that by Diane Sherry in Superman: The Movie, Annette O'Toole in its sequel Superman III, Stacy Haiduk in the television series Superboy, Kristin Kreuk in the television series Smallville, and Emmanuelle Chriqui in the television series Superman & Lois. == Publication history == Created by writer Bill Finger and artist John Sikela, the character first appears in Superboy #10 (September/October 1950). Across decades of Superman comics and adaptations into other media, Lana has most consistently been depicted as Superman's teenage romantic interest growing up in Smallville; as an adult, she is a friend of Superman in his civilian identity as Clark Kent. Lana is one of many Superman characters with the alliterative initials ""LL"", the most notable other examples being Superman's primary love interest Lois Lane and archnemesis, Lex Luthor. In the Silver Age, she regularly appeared in comic books depicting the adventures of Superman's teenaged self, Superboy, and also appeared as an adult in numerous Superman titles, vying with Lois Lane for his attention. In modern revisions of DC Comics continuity, she and Clark are shown to have remained friends since their teenage years. The story varies across different revisions of Superman's origin story. For example, in Superman: Secret Origin, Lana becomes privy to Clark's unusual abilities at an early age and becomes his earliest confidant outside of his parents and the futuristic

15,what kind of equipment did isaac newton use?,Telescope,Reflecting telescope,"Robert Hooke (; 18 July 1635 – 3 March 1703) was an English polymath who was active as a physicist (""natural philosopher""), astronomer, geologist, meteorologist and architect. He is credited as one of the first scientists to investigate living things at microscopic scale in 1665, using a compound microscope that he designed. Hooke was an impoverished scientific inquirer in young adulthood who went on to become one of the most important scientists of his time. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, Hooke (as a surveyor and architect) attained wealth and esteem by performing more than half of the property line surveys and assisting with the city's rapid reconstruction. Often vilified by writers in the centuries after his death, his reputation was restored at the end of the twentieth century and he has been called ""England's Leonardo [da Vinci]"". Hooke was a Fellow of the Royal Society and from 1662, he was its first Curator of Experiments. From 1665 to 1703, he was also Professor of Geometry at Gresham College. Hooke began his scientific career as an assistant to the physical scientist Robert Boyle. Hooke built the vacuum pumps that were used in Boyle's experiments on gas law and also conducted experiments. In 1664, Hooke identified the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. Hooke's 1665 book Micrographia, in which he coined the term cell, encouraged microscopic investigations. Investigating optics – specifically light refraction – Hooke inferred a wave theory of light. His is the first-recorded hypothesis of the cause of the expansion of matter by heat, of air's composition by small particles in constant motion that thus generate its pressure, and of heat as energy. In physics, Hooke inferred that gravity obeys an inverse square law and arguably was the first to hypothesise such a relation in planetary motion, a principle Isaac Newton furthered and formalised in Newton's law of universal gravitation. Priority over this insight contributed to the rivalry between Hooke and

a relation in planetary motion, a principle Isaac Newton furthered and formalised in Newton's law of universal gravitation. Priority over this insight contributed to the rivalry between Hooke and Newton. In geology and palaeontology, Hooke originated the theory of a terraqueous globe, thus disputing the Biblical view of the Earth's age; he also hypothesised the extinction of species, and argued hills and mountains had become elevated by geological processes. By identifying fossils of extinct species, Hooke presaged the theory of biological evolution. == Life and works == === Early life === Much of what is known of Hooke's early life comes from an autobiography he commenced in 1696 but never completed; Richard Waller FRS mentions it in his introduction to The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S., which was printed in 1705. The work of Waller, along with John Ward's Lives of the Gresham Professors, and John Aubrey's Brief Lives form the major near-contemporaneous biographical accounts of his life. Hooke was born in 1635 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, to Cecily Gyles and the Anglican priest John Hooke, who was the curate of All Saints' Church, Freshwater. Robert was the youngest, by seven years, of four siblings (two boys and two girls); he was frail and not expected to live. Although his father gave him some instruction in English, (Latin) Grammar and Divinity, Robert's education was largely neglected. Left to his own devices, he made little mechanical toys; seeing a brass clock dismantled, he built a wooden replica that ""would go"". Hooke's father died in October 1648, leaving £40 in his will to Robert (plus another £10 held over from his grandmother). At the age of 13, he took this to London to become an apprentice to the celebrated painter Peter Lely. Hooke also had ""some instruction in drawing"" from the limner Samuel Cowper but ""the smell of the Oil Colours did not agree with his Constitution, increasing his Head-ache to which he was ever too much

so a stone falls downward toward the center of the cosmos, but flames rise upward toward the circumference. Eventually, Aristotelian physics became popular for many centuries in Europe, informing the scientific and scholastic developments of the Middle Ages. It remained the mainstream scientific paradigm in Europe until the time of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. Early in Classical Greece, k

matters, so too (Hobbes might have thought) might we expect further scientists to succeed in explaining mental matters. Hobbes was very much interested in scientific explanation of the world: both its practice (which he saw himself as engaged in) and also its theory. Chapter 9 of Leviathan tells us something about the differences between scientific and historical knowledge, and the divisions between sciences. Chapter 6 of De Corpore gives a much fuller treatment of issues in the philosophy of science, issues of what Hobbes calls method. Method tells us how to investigate things in order to achieve scientia, the best sort of knowledge. Those writing about Hobbes's method have tended to tell one or other of two stories about the sort of method he proposes and its historical roots. One story emphasizes the connections between Hobbes's method and Aristotelian approaches. This has often been developed into a story about the particular influence on Hobbes of the works of Giacomo Zabarella, a sixteenth-century Aristotelian who studied and taught at the University of Padua, which influence is then often said to have been somehow mediated by Galileo. The alternative story emphasizes the connections between Hobbes's general views about method and the traditions of thinking about method in geometry. Here the notions of analysis and synthesis are key. Oddly enough, both of these stories can be connected to anecdotes that Aubrey tells about Hobbes: on the one hand, the report that Hobbes became friendly with Galileo while traveling in Italy, and on the other, the tale of how Hobbes became fascinated with geometry at the age of forty after looking at copy of Euclid's Elements, not believing a proposition, and tracing back the demonstration of it and the propositions on which it depended. This section tells a version of the first story. (For a helpful recent critical discussion of such an approach, see Hattab 2014.) Still, one should note that Hobbes sometimes uses the language

Physics is a branch of science in which the primary objects of study are matter and energy. These topics were discussed by philosophers across many cultures in ancient times, but they had no means to distinguish causes of natural phenomena from superstitions. The scientific revolution of the 17th century, especially the discovery of the law of gravity, began a process knowledge accumulation and specialization that gave rise to the field of physics. Mathematical advances of the 18th century gave rise to classical mechanics and the increased used of the experimental method lead new understanding of thermodynamics. In the 19th century, the basic laws of electromagnetism and statistical mechanics were discovered. Physics was transformed by the discoveries of quantum mechanics, relativity, and atomic theory at the beginning of the 20th century. Physics today may be divided loosely into classical physics and modern physics. Detailed articles on specific topics are available through the Outline of the history of physics. == Ancient history == Elements of what became physics were drawn primarily from the fields of astronomy, optics, and mechanics, which were methodologically united through the study of geometry. These mathematical disciplines began in antiquity with the Babylonians and with Hellenistic writers such as Archimedes and Ptolemy. Ancient philosophy, meanwhile, included what was called ""Physics"". === Greek concept === The move towards a rational understanding of nature began at least since the Archaic period in Greece (650–480 BCE) with the Pre-Socratic philosophers. The philosopher Thales of Miletus (7th and 6th centuries BCE), dubbed ""the Father of Science"" for refusing to accept various supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural phenomena, proclaimed that every event had a natural cause. Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is the basic element, experimenting with the attraction between magnets and rubbed",1,1,1,1

Black soldiers served in mostly integrated units at this time. The First Rhode Island Regiment is the most famous regiment that included African Americans during the American Revolution. In 1778 the Rhode Island Assembly voted to allow ""every able-bodied negro, mulatto, or Indian man slave in this state to enlist into either of the Continental Battalions being raised."" The assembly further stipulated that ""every slave so enlisting shall, upon his passing muster before Colonel Christopher Greene, be immediately discharged from the service of his master or mistress, and be absolutely free."" Rhode Island Enslavers opposed this new law and in June 1778, the state repealed this provision. However, 100 African Americans enlisted during that four month period. Another 44 enlisted after June of 1778. In the end 144 African Americans enlisted in the First Rhode Island out of a total of 225. Learn about some the African Americans who fought in the American Revolution below

Only 50 years after the defeat of the British at Yorktown, most Americans had already forgotten the extensive role Black people had played on both sides during the War for Independence. At the 1876 Centennial Celebration of the Revolution in Philadelphia, there was zero mention of the contributions of African Americans in the fight for independence. Yet by 1783, thousands of Black Americans had become involved in the war. Many fought in the war winning their freedom and others were victims, but throughout the struggle Blacks participated giving their loyalty to the side that would give them their freedom. By 1775 more than a half-million African Americans, most of them enslaved, were living in the 13 colonies. Early in the 18th century New England ministers and conscientious Quakers, such as George Keith and John Woolman, questioned slavery. They were ignored. By the 1760s as more colonists began to speak out against British tyranny, more Americans pointed out the contradiction between advocating liberty and owning slaves. In 1774 Abigail Adams wrote, ""it always appeared a most iniquitious scheme to me to fight ourselves for what we are daily robbing and plundering from those who have as good a right to freedom as we have."" Talk of liberty gave thousands of slaves high expectations, and many were ready to fight for a democratic revolution that might offer them freedom. In 1775 at least 10 to 15 Black soldiers, including some slaves, fought against the British at the battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill. Two of these men, Salem Poor and Peter Salem, earned special distinction for their bravery. By 1776, however, it had become clear that the revolutionary rhetoric of the founding fathers did not include enslaved Blacks. The Declaration of Independence promised liberty for all men but did not end slavery; and even though they were great fighters, the Continental Congress did not allow black soldiers to join the army. With no guarantee of freedom, many free and enslaved

Prior to the revolution, many free African Americans supported the anti-British cause, most famously Crispus Attucks, believed to be the first person killed at the Boston Massacre. At the time of the American Revolution, some Black men had already enlisted as minutemen. Both free and enslaved Africans had served in private militias, especially in the North, defending their villages against attacks by Native Americans. In March 1775, the Continental Congress assigned units of the Massachusetts militia as Minutemen. They were under orders to become activated if the British troops in Boston took the offensive. Peter Salem, who had been freed by his owner to join the Framingham militia, was one of the Black men in the military. He served for nearly five years. In the Revolutionary War, slave owners often let the people they enslaved to enlist in the war with promises of freedom, but many were put back into slavery after the conclusion of the war. In April 1775, at Lexington and Concord, Black men responded to the call and fought with Patriot forces. Prince Estabrook was wounded some time during the fighting on 19 April, probably at Lexington. The Battle of Bunker Hill also had African-American soldiers fighting along with white Patriots, such as Peter Salem; Salem Poor, Barzillai Lew, Blaney Grusha, Titus Coburn, Alexander Ames, Cato Howe, and Seymour Burr. Many African Americans, both enslaved and free, wanted to join with the Patriots. They believed that they would achieve freedom or expand their civil rights. In addition to the role of soldier, Black men also served as guides, messengers, and spies. On April 26, 1777, during Tyron's raid on Danbury Connecticut, a slave named Adams, in an act of reckless daring, was killed when firing upon the British. American states had to meet quotas of troops for the new Continental Army, and New England regiments recruited Black enslaved people by promising freedom to those who served in the Continental Army.

From a watercolor drawing in the diary of Jean Baptiste Antoine de Verger, an officer in Rochambeau's army during the American campaigns of 1780-81. Anne S.K. Brown Military Collection, Brown University Library Fact #1: Numbers in the Overall Population. At the onset of the War for Independence, approximately 500,000 African Americans lived in the colonies, of whom some 450,000 (90 percent) were enslaved. Blacks fought in provincial regiments prior to the war, and roughly 5,000 African American soldiers and sailors, free and slave, served the Revolutionary cause. While accurate numbers are hard to come by, the American population at the time was approximately 2.1 million; free blacks comprised 2.4 percent of the overall population, and slaves formed 21.5 percent. Fact #2: They Served from First to Last. Black Soldiers in the Continental Army and states' militia fought in every major battle of the war, and in most, if not all of the lesser actions. The same was not true of the Crown forces during the conflict. On April 19, 1775, Massachusetts militiamen of color, free and enslaved, along with their white comrades opposed British troops during the operations intended to seize American arms that ended in a harried retreat to the safety of Boston. Blacks served in Minute companies, as well as the normal embodied militia. To date, we have the names of 35 black men present that day, at least 18 seeing combat. One, Prince Estabrook, was wounded while with Captain John Parker's company on Lexington Green. Historian John Hannigan notes that, given incomplete records, it is likely that as many as 40 to 50 African Americans were with the militia on the war's first day. Three black veterans will serve to represent their many comrades. Former Pennsylvania private soldier Stacey Williams enlisted in April 1777, and served

states were reluctant to recruit enslaved African Americans for the army, they had no issue using free and enslaved Blacks in the navy. In Virginia alone, as many as 150 black men, many of them slaves, served in the state navy. After the war, the legislature granted several of these men their freedom as a reward for faithful service. African Americans also served as gunners, sailors on privateers and in the Continental Navy during the Revolution. Blacks did a lot of different roles in the military. From simple jobs to James Lafayette, gained renown serving as spies or orderlies for well-known military leaders. Black soldiers fought with the British as well as the Americans during the revolution. Enslaved Blacks choose whatever side that would help them gain their freedom. Most British officials did not want to let Blacks fight, but in 1775 Virginia's royal governor, Lord Dunmore, established an all-Black ""Ethiopian Regiment"" made of runaway slaves. By promising them freedom, Dunmore enticed over 800 enslaved people to escape from ""rebel"" enslavers. Whenever they could, enslaved Blacks continued to join him until he was defeated and forced to leave Virginia in 1776. Dunmore's innovative strategy met with disfavor in England, but to many Blacks the British army came to represent liberation.",1,1,1,5

As a member of the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA), he won championships in 2009 and 2010 and was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011. In high school, Odom received national player of the year honors from Parade in 1997. He played college basketball for the University of Rhode Island, earning all-conference honors during his only season in the Atlantic 10 Conference before turning professional. The Los Angeles Clippers selected Odom with the fourth overall pick in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team in the following year; it was during his four seasons with the Clippers, however, that he was twice suspended for violating the league's anti-drug policy. As a restricted free agent, he then signed with the Miami Heat, where he played the 2003–04 season before being traded to the Lakers. Odom spent seven seasons with the Lakers, who traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. After the move, his career declined. He was traded back to the Clippers in 2012 and played briefly in Spain in 2014. Odom played on the United States national team, winning a bronze medal in the Olympics in 2004 and a gold medal in the FIBA World Championship (later known as the World Cup) in 2010. Odom was married to Khloé Kardashian from 2009 to 2016. During their marriage, Odom made several appearances on the reality television show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. He and Kardashian also had their own reality series, Khloé & Lamar. In October 2015, Odom was hospitalized in a comatose state after being discovered unconscious in a Nevada brothel.

On her deathbed, she reportedly told him: ""Be nice to everybody."" Odom was afterwards raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer. In his first three years of high school, Odom played for Christ the King Regional High School in Middle Village, Queens. He left the school at the start of his senior year due to poor grades, transferring first to Redemption Christian Academy in Troy, New York, and then to the now-defunct St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New Britain, Connecticut, where he was coached by Jerry DeGregorio. As a senior, Odom was recognized nationally as the Parade Player of the Year in 1997. Among other distinctions, he earned USA Today All-USA First Team honors and was named to the Parade All-American First Team for the second consecutive year. While still in high school, Odom played on the same AAU team as future NBA teammates Elton Brand and Ron Artest (later known as Metta World Peace); he also played at the Adidas ABCD Camp with future Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant. Adidas executive Sonny Vaccaro commented at the time that Odom possessed a ""$2 million smile"". == College career == Though he considered entering the NBA directly from high school and consulted Kobe Bryant as a player who had made that jump, Odom ultimately decided that he was not ready and committed to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas instead. However, a Sports Illustrated story questioning the validity of his ACT score and an arrest for soliciting prostitution provided the school cause enough to revoke his scholarship, and for this reason, he never played for the Runnin' Rebels.

18,where did frank baum die?,Los Angeles,Hollywood,"Lyman Frank Baum (; May 15, 1856 – May 6, 1919) was an American author best known for his children's fantasy books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, part of a series. In addition to the 14 Oz books, Baum penned 41 other novels (not including four lost, unpublished novels), 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book became a landmark of 20th-century cinema. Born and raised in Chittenango, New York, Baum moved west after an unsuccessful stint as a theater producer and playwright. He and his wife opened a store in South Dakota and he edited and published a newspaper. They then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a newspaper reporter and published children's literature, coming out with the first Oz book in 1900. While continuing his writing, among his final projects he sought to establish a film studio focused on children's films in Los Angeles, California. His works anticipated such later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work). == Childhood and early life == Baum was born in Chittenango, New York, in 1856 into a devout Methodist family. He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (née Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. ""Lyman"" was the name of his father's brother (Lyman Spaulding Baum), but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name ""Frank"". His father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New

oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New York. Baum was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two years at Peekskill Military Academy, but after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly psychogenic heart attack and was allowed to return home. Baum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap printing press. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of The Rose Lawn Home Journal. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they gave to family and friends for free. By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called The Stamp Collector, printed an 11-page pamphlet called Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory, and started a stamp dealership with friends. At 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding poultry. He specialized in raising the Hamburg chicken. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, The Poultry Record and, in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs. Baum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the Fourth of July memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as Santa Claus for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the

Maud Gage Baum (née Gage; March 27, 1861 – March 6, 1953) was the wife of American children's publisher L. Frank Baum. Her mother was the suffragist Matilda Joslyn Gage. In her early life, she attended a boys' high school. Maud lived in Fayetteville, New York, with her aging parents until she married Frank in 1882, sacrificing her college education at Cornell University. At the onset of their marriage, she accompanied her husband's acting troupe throughout the United States. After she became pregnant, Maud and Frank settled down in a rented house, where she gave birth to Frank Joslyn in 1883. Complications arising from giving birth to her second son Robert Stanton in 1886 caused Maud to become afflicted with peritonitis. Ill for two years, she found solace in visiting her mother and siblings. In 1889 and 1891, she gave birth to Harry Neal and Kenneth Gage, respectively. Described by her children as a no-nonsense mother, Maud took charge of the family finances and the disciplining of her children. She was their primary caretaker because her husband's business obligations frequently led to his being away for weeks at a time. The family moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota, in 1888 because Maud wished to be near her brother and two sisters. After her husband was unable to sustain a living there, they moved to Chicago. Because of their dire financial situation, Maud also worked, teaching embroidery and lace-making. Beginning in 1900, her husband's best-selling picture book, Father Goose: His Book (first published in 1899), brought the family financial security that it had theretofore lacked. They began spending their summers at a cottage in Macatawa Park, Michigan. In November of that year, Frank transferred to Maud the literary rights of his most recent books, including Father Goose and From Kansas to Fairyland (later published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). By dint of Frank's literary successes, Maud and Frank were financially secure enough to tour Egypt and Europe for

Goose and From Kansas to Fairyland (later published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). By dint of Frank's literary successes, Maud and Frank were financially secure enough to tour Egypt and Europe for six months. Since Frank was frequently occupied with penning stories for his publishers, Maud was the one who wrote numerous letters home. These letters were later published in 1907 as In Other Lands Than Ours for friends and family. After Frank died, she authorized Ruth Plumly Thompson to write more Oz sequels and helped promote MGM's film The Wizard of Oz (1939). In 1953, she died at 91 years of age, surviving her husband by 34 years. == Early life == Born on March 27, 1861 to Matilda Joslyn Gage and Henry Hill Gage Maud was the youngest of their four children. She had two sisters, Helen Leslie Gage and Julia Gage Carpenter, and a brother, Thomas Clarkson Gage. Her mother was a feminist who fought for women's rights, and her father was a prosperous dry-goods retailer. A relative noted that Maud's mother was a ""woman of force"" who ""ruled her mild, gentle husband and her four children with a rod of iron"". Maud lived with her parents in a Greek Revival home in Fayetteville, New York. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz wrote that Maud had ""dark hair, a shapely figure, and eyes as sharp as her mind"". In her youth, Maud went to a boys' high school. Both she and her future husband, L. Frank Baum, attended Syracuse Classical School, a preparatory school in Syracuse, New York. In September 1880, Maud headed to Cornell University, leaving on a train and arriving at an Ithaca depot two hours later. Her brother, Clarkson, had graduated as one of the top of the class, though her elder sisters did not attend a university. When Maud arrived at the university, she intended to be the family's first woman to receive a complete degree. Her mother dreamed of her becoming a doctor or a lawyer, which would be a rare accomplishment for a woman. Though Maud had very little knowledge about being on

19,which country won the crimean war?,Russia,Russian Empire,"Who fought the Crimean War? The Crimean War was fought between Russia and the forces of Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire, later joined by the army of Sardinia-Piedmont. What led to the Crimean War? The Crimean War was the result of Russian demands to exercise protection over the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman sultan. Another cause was a dispute between Russia and France over the privileges of the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in Palestine. More broadly, struggles between the great powers in the Middle East led to war. What was the outcome of the Crimean War? After Austria threatened to join the allies during the Crimean War, Russia accepted preliminary peace terms in 1856. The Congress of Paris worked out the final settlement. The resulting Treaty of Paris, signed on March 30, 1856, guaranteed the integrity of Ottoman Turkey and obliged Russia to surrender southern Bessarabia at the mouth of the Danube. How many people died in the Crimean War? The Crimean War produced about 500,000 total casualties, with about half suffered by each side. A disproportionate number of deaths were caused by disease. How did the Crimean War affect the future treatment of wounded soldiers? After details of the deplorable conditions faced by wounded soldiers during the Crimean War reached the British public, nurses such as Mary Seacole and Florence Nightingale worked to improve their medical care. Their work paved the way for later developments in battlefield medicine. Crimean WarBritish soldiers leaving for the Crimean War, February 1854. Supported by Britain, the Turks took a firm stand against the Russians, who occupied the Danubian principalities (modern Romania) on the Russo-Turkish border in July 1853.

On October 4 the Turks declared war on Russia and in the same month opened an offensive against the Russians in the Danubian principalities. After the Russian Black Sea fleet destroyed

The Crimean War was fought from October 1853 to February 1856 between the Russian Empire and an ultimately victorious alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, the United Kingdom, and Sardinia-Piedmont. Geopolitical causes of the war included the decline of the Ottoman Empire (the ""Eastern Question""), the expansion of Russia in the preceding Russo-Turkish Wars, and the British and French preference to preserve the Ottoman Empire to maintain the balance of power in the Concert of Europe. The flashpoint was a disagreement over the rights of Christian minorities in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire, with the French promoting the rights of Roman Catholics, and Russia promoting those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. However, this served only as a pretense for the war; in fact, the countries were fighting over who would rule the Ottoman Empire. The churches worked out their differences with the Ottomans and came to an agreement, but both the French Emperor Napoleon III and the Russian tsar Nicholas I refused to back down. Nicholas issued an ultimatum that demanded the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise to which Nicholas agreed. When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement, Nicholas recanted and prepared for war. In July 1853, Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities (now part of Romania but then under Ottoman suzerainty). On 16 October [O.S. 4 October] 1853, having obtained promises of support from France and Britain, the Ottomans declared war on Russia. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the Russian advance at Silistra (now in Bulgaria). A separate action on the fort town of Kars, in the Ottoman Empire, led to a siege, and an Ottoman attempt to reinforce the garrison was destroyed by a Russian fleet at the Battle of Sinop in November 1853. Fearing the growth of influence of the Russian Empire, the British and

Crimean War The Crimean War (1854-56) was fought by an alliance of Britain, France, Turkey and Sardinia against Russia. It was the only major European conflict the Army engaged in between 1816 and 1914. For the British, the campaign was symbolised by military and logistical incompetence alongside the bravery and endurance of its soldiers. Related topics Russian menace The Crimean War started with Russia's invasion of the Turkish Danubian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (now Romania). Britain and France both wanted to prop up the ailing Ottoman Empire and resist Russian expansionism in the Near East. Although Russia fought a largely successful war against the Turks in Armenia, and British and French fleets operated in the Baltic Sea, it was the events in the Crimea that had the biggest impact on Britain. Allies intervene In June 1854, British and French armies concentrated at Varna on the Black Sea with a view to supporting the Turks. However, the Russians were defeated by Ottoman Turkey at Silistria in the summer of 1854 and, under pressure from Austria, evacuated the disputed provinces. This made the British and French presence at Varna largely redundant. Map of the Crimea and the Black Sea, 1854 Nevertheless, the British government, influenced by public opinion at home, decided that the Russian naval base at Sevastopol should be attacked instead. The French agreed. And on 14 September, the Allies landed on the north-west coast of the Crimea at Calamita Bay. The Alma By 18 September, 30,000 French under Marshal St Arnaud, 26,000 British under General Lord Raglan, and 4,500 Turks had been landed. Despite outbreaks of cholera among the troops, the Allies marched south on Sevastopol. Blocking the way was a Russian force under Prince Alexander Sergeievich Menshikoff, which had taken up a strong position on the heights above the River Alma. On 20 September, the Allies attacked and, despite confused leadership, the British stormed the main Russian position. The

Explore the National Park Service Exiting nps.gov Contact Us The Crimean War On March 28, 1854, Great Britain and France declared war on Russia, joining the Ottoman Empire in a conflict that became known as The Crimean War. European powers had not fought a major war against each other since the Napoleonic Wars which ended in 1815. The Crimean War was an imperial war fought on many fronts, including modern day Ukraine, the Baltic Seas, and the Kamchatka Peninsula of East Asia. During the war, modern weaponry and new mass media technologies, such as steamships and telegraphy heightened the intensity of the conflict and brought details of the war rapidly to the global public. Many of the British Royal Marines stationed at English Camp were veterans of the Crimean War. The Crimean War lasted from 1854 until 1856 and encompassed trench warfare, amphibious assaults, and naval blockades. The primary center of the conflict was in Central Asia, including areas in Ukraine that are now embroiled in conflict, where the Russian Empire fought an alliance of Ottoman, English, and French forces. The official cause of the war was a dispute between the Russian Czar, Nicholas I and the Ottoman Emperor, Abdulmejid I, over which empire would have authority over Orthodox Christians living in Ottoman territory. This religious dispute was a pretext for European powers to project power against each other. At the time the war began in October of 1853, the Ottoman Empire's Western European allies were concerned with Russian imperial expansion and viewed this religious and political disagreement as an opportunity to check Russian expansion through superior military force. The Ottoman Empire, which had recently lost territories in Western Europe to nationalist revolutions believed that with the support of the more powerful French and British imperial militaries they could reinvigorate their empire and secure their borders. Thought the argument over religious freedom was the reason this global

The Outcome of the Crimean War On 30th March 1856, the Crimean War was formally brought to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Paris... Jessica Brain 11 min read On 30th March 1856, the Crimean War was formally brought to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. This formal recognition signed at the Congress of Paris came after Russia accepted a humiliating defeat against the alliance of Britain, France, the Ottoman Empire and Sardinia. The treaty itself would address Russian expansionism, quashing dreams of a Russian empire equal to none, whilst at the same time confirming the importance of the Ottoman Empire in maintaining a very tentative balance of power in Europe. The Crimean War which had begun in October 1853 lasted eighteen months and in that time had escalated into a series of fragmented battles and sieges, causing huge loss of life and highlighting wider issues and failures pertaining to leadership, military intervention, mortality rates, medicine and mismanagement. The war itself garnered a great deal of attention and proved to be a significant and defining moment for Europe. It was first and foremost the embodiment of a 'modern war', using new technologies that would later characterise the wars of the next century. Furthermore, the coverage of the war in newspapers, particularly in Britain allowed the general public to experience the horrors of war in a new and provocative way, thanks to reporting by the likes of William Howard Russell for The Times newspaper. This overseas reporting combined with information from significant figures such as Florence Nightingale, would paint an extremely unfavourable picture leading to demands for reforms.

20,who formed the american federation of labor?,George Meany,Samuel Gompers,"Formation of the American Federation of Labor The American Federation of Labor (A.F. of L. or AFL) was founded on December 8, 1886. Its predecessor, the Federation of Organized Trade and Labor Unions (FOTLU), was formed by members of the Knights of Labor (KOL) and labor leaders including Samuel Gompers. Following the Haymarket affair on May 4, 1886, FOTLU and trade union leaders convened in Columbus, Ohio in December of that year. They announced the formation of the A.F. of L., with Samuel Gompers becoming its first and longest serving president.1 In the following decades, the American Federation of Labor became the largest federation of labor unions in the United States. Unfortunately, it largely excluded unions with high percentages of minority workers with the notable exception of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Also, it was not particularly friendly toward industrial unions, leading those unions to leave the A.F. of L. and form the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). However, the two entities would eventually merge to form the AFL-CIO in December of 1955.

The American Federation of Labor (A.F. of L.) was a national federation of labor unions in the United States that continues today as the AFL-CIO. It was founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1886 by an alliance of craft unions eager to provide mutual support and disappointed in the Knights of Labor. Samuel Gompers was elected the full-time president at its founding convention and was re-elected every year except one until his death in 1924. He became the major spokesperson for the union movement. The A.F. of L. was the largest union grouping, even after the creation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) by unions that were expelled by the A.F. of L. in 1935. The A.F. of L. was founded and dominated by craft unions, especially in the building trades. In the late 1930s, craft affiliates expanded by organizing on an industrial union basis to meet the challenge from the CIO. The A.F. of L. and the CIO competed bitterly in the late 1930s but then cooperated during World War II and afterward. In 1955, the two merged to create the AFL-CIO, which has comprised the longest lasting and most influential labor federation in the United States to this day. == Organizational history == === Origins === The American Federation of Labor (A.F. of L.) was organized as an association of trade unions in 1886. The organization emerged from a dispute with the Knights of Labor (K of L) organization, in which the leadership of that organization solicited locals of various craft unions to withdraw from their International organizations and to affiliate with the K of L directly, an action which would have moved funds from the various unions to the K of L. The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions also merged into what would become the American Federation of Labor. One of the organizations embroiled in this controversy was the Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU), a group subject to competition from a dual union, a rival ""Progressive Cigarmakers' Union"", organized by members

The labor movement gained strength in the 1850s in such crafts as typographers, molders, and carpenters. Fixed standards of apprenticeship and of wages, hours, and working conditions were drafted. Although such agreements often broke down in periods of depression, a strong nucleus of craft unions had developed by the 1880s so that a central federation emerged. This was the American Federation of Labor. Samuel Gompers (1850-1924) was the first president of the American Federation of Labor, the first enduring national labor union. He served as president from 1886 until his death in 1924, except for a single year, 1895. Born in London, he immigrated to the United States at the age of 13, and worked as a cigar-maker. He became the leader of the cigar-makers' union, and transformed it into one of the country's strongest unions. Gompers believed that labor had the most to gain by organizing skilled craft workers, rather than attempting to organize all workers in an industry. He refused to form an alliance with the Knights of Labor. ""Talk of harmony with the Knights of Labor,"" he said, ""is bosh. They are just as great enemies of trade unions as any employer can be."" Gompers repudiated socialism and advocated a pragmatic ""pure and simple"" unionism that emphasized agreements with employees--which would spell out for a stipulated period the wages, hours of work, and the procedures for handling grievances. Gompers proposed that agreements contain clauses stipulating that employers hire only union members (the closed shop) and that any employee should be required to pay union dues. Employers advocated the open shop, which could employ non-union members. During the 1880s and 1890s, unions sought to secure and retain a foothold in such major industries as railways, steel, mining, and construction. It was in the building trades where the craft principle was most dominant that the American Federation of Labor developed its largest membership. Miners merged their crafts into the

The records of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) span the years 1883-1925 and consist of letterpress volumes of correspondence of Samuel Gompers (1850-1924) and William Green (1870-1952), presidents of the organization, and by other officials including James Duncan, Gabriel Edmonston, Frank Keyes Foster, and John McBride.

Samuel Gompers (Samuel Gumpertz) spent his early years as a cigar maker. The family immigrated to the United States in 1863 and settled in New York City. Father and son continued in the cigar trade and Samuel joined the Cigar Makers Local Union. In his mid-twenties Gompers was elected president of the local Cigar Makers' International Union where he continued working his way up through the union ranks. In 1881, he helped found the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions which became the American Federation of Labor (A. F. of L. or AFL). He became its first president and served as such for most of the rest of his life. The first Labor Day holiday was celebrated on Tuesday, September 5, 1882 at the behest of the Central Labor Union. The Central Labor Union pushed other organizations to follow and by 1894 23 other states had adopted the holiday. On May 4, 1886, a bomb detonates near

For most of the 19th century, the American labour movement had two components: a labour-reform branch, which fought for equal rights for workers in a world divided into the rich and the poor, and the trade unions, which pursued higher wages for workers and addressed their day-to-day needs. During the 1880s the functional separation between the two strands began breaking down. Craft (skill-based) unions came to dominate the trade-union structure and became increasingly territorial. At the same time the KOL, which had previously focused on labour-reform issues, began conducting strikes and organizing workers along industry-wide rather than craft lines, effectively performing as a rival trade-union movement. Moreover, in attempting to incorporate the existing craft unions, the KOL limited their autonomy and pulled them into political and social disputes that did not directly involve their own interests. In December 1886, after the KOL rejected a proposal reaffirming the historic separation of trade-union and labour-reform functions, the craft unions revolted. Led by Samuel Gompers, an English immigrant who had organized cigar makers, the craft unions established the American Federation of Labor. Dedicated to the principles of craft unionism, the AFL brought together some 100 national and international unions, which were allowed to remain autonomous. Each union was granted ""exclusive jurisdiction"" over a craft. This allocation sparked some heated jurisdictional disputes between the federation's affiliated unions, but it did not prevent union membership from growing. Guided by Gompers and a clutch of Marxist trade unionists, the AFL embraced ""pure and simple"" unionism as its credo. Unlike the KOL, the AFL was not immersed in national political issues. Instead, it focused on obtaining the right to bargain collectively for wages, benefits, hours, and working conditions. The pursuit of labour reform was removed from the agenda of American workers.

Jordan's reign was overall disappointing. In 13 seasons under his leadership, the team went 423-600, made just three playoff appearances and did not win a single series. During the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, the then-Bobcats went 7-59, which is the worst record in NBA history -- both in terms of fewest wins and lowest winning percentage. One of the few memorable accomplishments during the Jordan era was reclaiming the Hornets' name and original franchise records and history. Last season, the Hornets went 27-55, which was the fourth-worst record in the league. They won the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and used it to select Brandon Miller out of Alabama. That was a slightly controversial choice with Scoot Henderson still on the board, but regardless the Hornets will go into the future with an interesting young duo in Miller and LaMelo Ball.

22,what was dr seuss's real name?,Theodor Geisel,Theodor Robert Geisel,"Celebrating Dr. Seuss As a child, I remember that the first children's book I read was by Dr. Seuss. Many children, including myself, first learned to read books by Dr. Seuss. His illustrations were eye-catching, and the titles of his stories were creative and memorable. Dr. Seuss's full name was Theodore ""Ted"" Seuss Geisel. He was born on March 2nd, 1904. Geisel was an author, political cartoonist, illustrator, poet, animator, screenwriter, and filmmaker. He wrote more than 60 children's books and had a major impact on society. This month we should pay tribute to a man who had a major influence on children's literature. Ted Geisel's Early Life & Education Geisel was born in Springfield, Massachusetts to Henrietta and Theodore Geisel. His father owned and managed a brewery, but due to the Prohibition movement, it was permanently closed. In 1931, Geisel's father, Theodore, was hired to supervise Springfield's public parks. Theodore would often take his son to Springfield Zoo located within the parks. The zoo was a major part of Ted's childhood. Geisel enjoyed drawing pictures of the animals at the zoo. If his father couldn't take him, he would often go with his mother or sister. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, and became close friends with the students in his graduating class. He graduated in 1925, and then decided to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy in English Literature. At the time, he had wanted to become a professor. While at Oxford, he met Helen Palmer, who he later married in 1927. She persuaded him to pursue drawing as a career, and to give up becoming a Philosophy professor. Geisel dropped out of Oxford without earning a degree and returned to the United States. Career as a Cartoonist At the beginning of World War II, Geisel began illustrating political cartoons for PM Magazine. His cartoons often would depict satirical illustrations of major historical figures. In 1943, Ted boarded a train to California and joined the U.S. army. Ted was deployed to the Fox

Lyman Frank Baum (; May 15, 1856 – May 6, 1919) was an American author best known for his children's fantasy books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, part of a series. In addition to the 14 Oz books, Baum penned 41 other novels (not including four lost, unpublished novels), 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book became a landmark of 20th-century cinema. Born and raised in Chittenango, New York, Baum moved west after an unsuccessful stint as a theater producer and playwright. He and his wife opened a store in South Dakota and he edited and published a newspaper. They then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a newspaper reporter and published children's literature, coming out with the first Oz book in 1900. While continuing his writing, among his final projects he sought to establish a film studio focused on children's films in Los Angeles, California. His works anticipated such later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work). == Childhood and early life == Baum was born in Chittenango, New York, in 1856 into a devout Methodist family. He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (née Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. ""Lyman"" was the name of his father's brother (Lyman Spaulding Baum), but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name ""Frank"". His father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New

Maud Gage Baum (née Gage; March 27, 1861 – March 6, 1953) was the wife of American children's publisher L. Frank Baum. Her mother was the suffragist Matilda Joslyn Gage. In her early life, she attended a boys' high school. Maud lived in Fayetteville, New York, with her aging parents until she married Frank in 1882, sacrificing her college education at Cornell University. At the onset of their marriage, she accompanied her husband's acting troupe throughout the United States. After she became pregnant, Maud and Frank settled down in a rented house, where she gave birth to Frank Joslyn in 1883. Complications arising from giving birth to her second son Robert Stanton in 1886 caused Maud to become afflicted with peritonitis. Ill for two years, she found solace in visiting her mother and siblings. In 1889 and 1891, she gave birth to Harry Neal and Kenneth Gage, respectively. Described by her children as a no-nonsense mother, Maud took charge of the family finances and the disciplining of her children. She was their primary caretaker because her husband's business obligations frequently led to his being away for weeks at a time. The family moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota, in 1888 because Maud wished to be near her brother and two sisters. After her husband was unable to sustain a living there, they moved to Chicago. Because of their dire financial situation, Maud also worked, teaching embroidery and lace-making. Beginning in 1900, her husband's best-selling picture book, Father Goose: His Book (first published in 1899), brought the family financial security that it had theretofore lacked. They began spending their summers at a cottage in Macatawa Park, Michigan. In November of that year, Frank transferred to Maud the literary rights of his most recent books, including Father Goose and From Kansas to Fairyland (later published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). By dint of Frank's literary successes, Maud and Frank were financially secure enough to tour Egypt and Europe for

Goose and From Kansas to Fairyland (later published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). By dint of Frank's literary successes, Maud and Frank were financially secure enough to tour Egypt and Europe for six months. Since Frank was frequently occupied with penning stories for his publishers, Maud was the one who wrote numerous letters home. These letters were later published in 1907 as In Other Lands Than Ours for friends and family. After Frank died, she authorized Ruth Plumly Thompson to write more Oz sequels and helped promote MGM's film The Wizard of Oz (1939). In 1953, she died at 91 years of age, surviving her husband by 34 years. == Early life == Born on March 27, 1861 to Matilda Joslyn Gage and Henry Hill Gage Maud was the youngest of their four children. She had two sisters, Helen Leslie Gage and Julia Gage Carpenter, and a brother, Thomas Clarkson Gage. Her mother was a feminist who fought for women's rights, and her father was a prosperous dry-goods retailer. A relative noted that Maud's mother was a ""woman of force"" who ""ruled her mild, gentle husband and her four children with a rod of iron"". Maud lived with her parents in a Greek Revival home in Fayetteville, New York. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz wrote that Maud had ""dark hair, a shapely figure, and eyes as sharp as her mind"". In her youth, Maud went to a boys' high school. Both she and her future husband, L. Frank Baum, attended Syracuse Classical School, a preparatory school in Syracuse, New York. In September 1880, Maud headed to Cornell University, leaving on a train and arriving at an Ithaca depot two hours later. Her brother, Clarkson, had graduated as one of the top of the class, though her elder sisters did not attend a university. When Maud arrived at the university, she intended to be the family's first woman to receive a complete degree. Her mother dreamed of her becoming a doctor or a lawyer, which would be a rare accomplishment for a woman. Though Maud had very little knowledge about being on",5,1,5,1

Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is the administrative capital and seat of the national legislature and Colombo is the commercial center of Sri Lanka. Faced with the problem of congestion in the capital city of Colombo the government of Sri Lanka designated Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte as the country's administrative capital. Sri Lanka is one of the Asian countries with two capitals alongside South Korea. National Capitals Of Sri Lanka The two capitals of Sri Lanka represent the two largest urban areas in the country, with a combined population of over 800,000. While Colombo is an economic center in Sri Lanka and the greater South Asia, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte relieves Colombo of its congestion by housing government institutions. Colombo Colombo is a port city located in the southwestern part of the country. The city derives its principal significance due to its port, which is one of the largest human-made harbors in the world. It is also a major world port for both passenger and cargo ships.Colombo has a rich history as witnessed in its Dutch and British colonial style buildings. It has been an important port for traders throughout time, from Arab, Chinese, and Portuguese to Dutch. The city became the capital of the British Crown Colony of Ceylon in 1802 and capital of an independent Sri Lanka in 1948. As the chief economic center of the country, Colombo is home to industries such as gem-cutting, chemical manufacture, textile and clothing, cement, glass production, and food processing. Colombo handles most of the country's foreign trade and is home to the Insurance Corporation, Government corporations, World Trade Centre, and multiple multinational headquarters. Important government ministries and institutions are also located in the city such as the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; President's House; Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Defence; Air Force Headquarters; Prime Minister's Office and

are also located in the city such as the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; President's House; Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Defence; Air Force Headquarters; Prime Minister's Office and Naval Headquarters. Colombo is the most significant city in Sri Lanka, given its trade and commercial supremacy. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is the official capital city of Sri Lanka. Founded in the 14th Century, Sri Jayawardenepura served as the official capital of the Sinhalese Kingdom of Kotte up to the 16th century. The city was then occupied by the Portuguese who fortified the city and later moved to Colombo once overwhelmed by the continuous attacks from the neighboring Sitawaka Kingdom. The city was designated as the new capital in 1977, after the government outgrew the independence capital, Colombo. In 1982, the new parliament was inaugurated in the city and other ministries began filing in. Sri Jayawardenepura is the administrative capital of Sri Lanka, and more government institutions continue to be relocated to the city from Colombo. The city is also home to the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, one of the leading higher institutions in the country. Role Of The Two Capitals Of Sri Lanka In The Governance Of The Country Primarily, having two capitals was set to minimize traffic and population congestion in Colombo and thus minimize environmental damage due to congestion. Having two capitals in Sri Lanka enables the government to counter rapid urbanization and provide better infrastructure facilities. Sri Lanka's government aims for efficiency in governance, where Colombo is the commercial center and Sri Jayawardenepura is the center of administration.

Sri Lanka, island country lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait. It is located between latitudes 5deg55' and 9deg51' N and longitudes 79deg41' and 81deg53' E and has a maximum length of 268 miles (432 km) and a maximum width of 139 miles (224 km). Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a crossroads of maritime routes traversing the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian civilizations. Ancient Greek geographers called it Taprobane. Arabs referred to it as Serendib. Later European mapmakers called it Ceylon, a name still used occasionally for trade purposes. It officially became Sri Lanka in 1972. The distinctive civilization of Sri Lanka, with roots that can be traced back to the 6th century bce, is characterized by two factors: the preservation of TheravadaBuddhism (the orthodox school of Buddhism having its literary traditions in the Pali language) and the development over two millennia of a sophisticated system of irrigation in the drier parts of the country. This civilization was further enriched by the influences of Hinduism and Islam. Colombo, which emerged as the main urban centre during British rule, remains the executive and judicial capital of Sri Lanka; Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, a Colombo suburb, is the legislative capital. For administrative purposes, the country has been divided into nine provinces and subdivided into 25 districts. Sri Lanka is densely populated. The majority of its people are poor, live in rural areas, and depend on agriculture for their livelihood. A physical environment of wide-ranging diversity makes Sri Lanka one of the world's most scenic countries. As the home of several ethnic groups, each with its own cultural heritage, Sri Lanka also has a highly varied cultural landscape.

Manning actively encouraged the concept of ""communal representation"" and created the Colombo town seat in 1920, which alternated between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. After their election to the State Council in 1936, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) members N.M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. In November

forces were raping and torturing Tamils involved in collating deaths and disappearances. Since the end of the civil war, the Sri Lankan state has been subject to much global criticism for violating human rights as a result of committing war crimes through bombing civilian targets, usage of heavy weaponry, the abduction and massacres of Sri Lankan Tamils and sexual violence. The LTTE gained notoriety for carrying out numerous attacks against civilians of all ethnicities, particularly those of Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Muslim ethnicity, using child soldiers, assassinations of politicians and dissenters, and the use of suicide bombings against military, political and civilian targets. == Origin and evolution == The origins of the Sri Lankan civil war lie in the continuous political rancor between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. The roots of the modern conflict extend back to the colonial era, when the country was known as Ceylon. The British colonial period lasted from 1815 to 1948, during which the British sought monetary gain from Sri Lanka's supply of tea, coffee, coconuts, and rubber. A labour shortage led the British to employ Tamils from India to work on tea plantations, furthering fears of racial decline among the Sinhalese. English language schools were also established in Jaffna by the American Ceylon Mission, which provided English-language skills for the Tamil population in Jaffna. The British favored English speakers, so Tamils outcompeted their Sinhalese counterparts in the civil service sector. In 1919, major Sinhalese and Tamil political organizations united to form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of Ponnambalam Arunachalam, to press the colonial government for more constitutional reforms. British colonial administrator William Manning actively encouraged the concept of ""communal representation"" and created the Colombo town seat in 1920, which alternated between the Tamils and the Sinhalese.

With just seven likely seats in the 89-member Parliament following Saturday's drubbing, Labor will soon face another electoral test, with a by-election looming in Ms Bligh's seat of South Brisbane after the premier of five years announced plans to stand aside.

Anna Bligh with her official campaign bus in Rockhampton, central Queensland, on February 20.Credit: Peter Wallis/pool ""I think longevity in government is very very difficult. It's a cancer that's very, very difficult to eradicate,"" she said, pointing to its combination with the controversial post-election asset sales decision, the long-running Queensland Health pay problems, and the very negative Labor campaign approach. ""When you put all of them together, and longevity, people were in the mood for change and no one was going to be able to swim against that tidal wave."" Premier Anna Bligh cooking alongside Jamie Oliver in Ipswich. Costly sales Ms Grace, who retained former premier Peter Beattie's seat after he quit politics in 2007, said Ms Bligh had been unable to convince the public of the merits of her decision in mid-2009 to privatise public assets, including Queensland Rail's coal haulage and bulk freight arm. ""Anna clearly believed she did the right thing under the circumstances,"" Ms Grace said. ""[But] we didn't bring people with us, that's more than obvious, and when you do that in politics it's suicide."" Ms Bligh has continued to argue that by making the ""tough"" asset sales decision she protected the infrastructure building program amid the GFC fallout, in

Preference count Labor Party Barbara O'Shea Greens Amy MacMahon (MP) Final figures. Full distribution of preferences published. On the exclusion of the fourth placed One Nation candidate, preferences split 67.6% to LNP, 15.4% Labor and 17.0%. That left Labor 105 votes ahead of the LNP in the battle to finish second on primary votes. It led to the LNP candidate being excluded and LNP preferences electing Labor's Barbara O'Shea. Had Labor slipped to third, Labor preferences would have re-elected the Greens' Amy MacMahon. MP Profile South Brisbane covers the inner southern suburbs of Brisbane directly opposite the Brisbane CBD. The electorate includes West End, Highgate Hill, Kangaroo Point, East Brisbane, South Brisbane, Woolloongabba, Dutton Park and parts of Annerley. The electorate includes Southbank, the Brisbane Exhibition Centre, the 'Gabba' Cricket Ground and Princess Alexandra Hospital. South Brisbane is the state's smallest electorate in area covering just 12 square kilometres. Background In various forms South Brisbane has existed as an electorate since the then colony's first election in 1860. It was the seat of Vince Gair 1932-60, former Labor Premier, DLP Senator and (briefly) Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. After being won by the Liberal Party at the 1974 landslide, South Brisbane was recovered for Labor by Jim Fouras in 1977, holding the seat until 1986 when he lost a pre-selection battle with Anne Warner, whose neighbouring seat of Kurilpa had been absorbed into South Brisbane. Fouras later represented Ashgrove 1989-2006, while Warner served as a Minister in the Goss government before retiring in 1995 to be succeeded by Anna Bligh. Bligh served as a senior Minister in the Beattie government and succeeded Beattie as Premier in 2007. Bligh led Labor to a difficult victory in 2009, but her government was thrashed at the 2012 election, Bligh being one of only seven Labor members elected. Bligh resigned from Parliament within a week of her defeat

which is now kicking in. ""Someone else will have their smiling face attached to it."" Grey skies to clear up? On Saturday night, a smiling Mr Newman heaped praise on Ms Bligh for one aspect of her time in office - her ""inspirational"" leadership during the 2010/11 flood and cyclone disasters. It's a view shared by Mr Pitt in his north Queensland electorate. ""Regardless of the election outcome ... she is still the same woman who has led the state through the global financial crisis and certainly the same woman who was seen by people all around the world leading through the most severe natural disasters in Queensland's history,"" Mr Pitt said. ""So she's made an indelible mark on Queensland politics."" But not everyone has been so glowing. Electoral analyst Malcolm Mackerras, who has a Liberal Party background, said the result on Saturday was ""completely inevitable and totally predictable"". He said Ms Bligh had behaved ""selfishly"" when she resigned her seat the day after the election and that she would be remembered, not for the floods, but as the leader who led the Labor party to their most disastrous defeat in history. ""She performed well (during the floods) and everyone outside of Queensland admired her,"" he said. ""But it was just a television performance and always was. ""It doesn't alter the main thing about her and that is she led her government to a truly disastrous defeat to which there is no precedent. ""In a few years people will not remember her good television performance during the floods."" Independent Queensland MP Peter Wellington said he had always been able to work well with Ms Bligh despite ""passionately disagreeing"" at times. Asked about her legacy, Mr Wellington said: ""That's a hard call to make."" ""...I will say this about Anna Bligh in previous roles though, when she was minister for communities she was instrumental in supporting a new respite service in my electorate. ""When she was education minister she supported my call for a whole range of new

Following the declaration of Brisbane's Lord Mayor that he is running for state parliament at the next election, and will be the leader of the opposition for that campaign, there is a trope making the rounds that he is somehow ""unelected"". Out of curiosity, I decided to see how his numbers in the Brisbane City Council elections in 2008 stacked up against Anna Bligh's numbers in the 2009 state election. The internet being what it is, official sources for these numbers weren't too hard to dig up: I found the Lord Mayoral results on the Brisbane City Council site I found the Electorate of South Brisbane results on the Electoral Commission Qld site (with the preferences taken into account here). Results: Campbell Newman received 335,076 first preference votes for Lord Mayor (60% of the total). After distribution of preferences, he received a total of 339,320 votes (66% of the total). It's probably worth noting that the second placed candidate received 29% of the first round votes, increasing to 34% after distribution of preferences, so Newman actually did receive the majority of the remaining preferences, there just weren't many to go around. Anna Bligh received 12,243 first preference votes in her electorate of South Brisbane (48% of the total). After distribution of preferences, she received a total of 14,697 votes (65% of the total). So, our State Premier holds her position on the back of the support of her party and around 15k people living in or near South Brisbane. The new leader of the opposition will hold that position on the back of the support of his party and around 340k people living in the City of Brisbane. Since the current population of Qld is estimated at 4.5 million people, effectively 7.5% of the state voted for Newman to be Brisbane's Lord Mayor, while only 0.3% voted for Bligh to represent the seat of South Brisbane. And people are calling Newman an unelected leader? (Yes, I'm aware that the nature of parliamentary governments based on geographic

to a difficult victory in 2009, but her government was thrashed at the 2012 election, Bligh being one of only seven Labor members elected. Bligh resigned from Parliament within a week of her defeat and was succeeded at an April 2012 by-election by Jackie Trad. As an increasingly affluent inner-city seat, South Brisbane is a seat where the Greens have been increasingly competitive. The Greens polled 20% at the 2004 election, 21.5% in 2006 and 17.9% in a field of nine candidates in 2009, 18.1% at the 2012 election and 21.9% in 2015. At the 2012 by-election following Bligh's abrupt departure, the Greens polled 19.4% and Labor just 32.9% to 38.0% for the LNP. Green preferences were critical in allowing Labor to come from behind and win. Labor then won easily in 2015 with the Greens a distant third. The contest was closer in 2017, Labor leading on first preferences with 36.0% to the Greens 34.4%, the LNP third with 24.3%. The LNP recommended preferences to Labor, 62% of LNP voters followed the recommendation, and Labor's Jackie Trad was re-elected with 53.6% versus the Greens. In 2020 the Greens finally broke through to win. Jackie Trad had attracted considerable controversy in the previous term and had to resign as Deputy Premier and Treasurer. The LNP chose to be strategic rather than ideological with its preferences and placed Trad below the Greens on the LNP how-to-vote. The 2020 first preference result saw the Greens leading on 37.9%, Trad slipping to second with 34.4% and the LNP third on 22.8%. The swap of LNP preferences flipped about 4,000 votes between the two elections. Had LNP preferences flowed as in 2016, Jackie Trad could have been narrowly re-elected. With LNP preferences reversed, the Greens' Amy MacMahon won easily with 55.3% of the two-candidate preferred vote, a swing from Labor to the Greens of 8.9%.

25,what form of currency does china have?,Renminbi,Renminbi,"What is the currency in China? Currency and Payment The Chinese currency, the yuan (or, officially, the renminbi), is the currency used throughout China except in the regions of Hong Kong and Macao. Whether it's about your budget, expenses, or the cost of living, learning about Chinese currency (coins and notes, payment, withdrawals, etc.) ensures a more relaxing and less expensive stay. In this guide, you'll learn everything you need to know about currency in China so that you can set off to the Middle Kingdom with complete confidence. What is the official Chinese currency? The official currency of China is the renminbi, more often called the yuan. It is issued by the People's Bank of China: Its symbol is ""Y="" or ""Yuan ,"" Its abbreviation is RMB or CNY, 1 euro is worth around79 yuan, Each yuan can be divided into 10 jiao (cents). In everyday speak, it's common to hear the names kuai and mao used to refer to yuan and jiao, respectively. Chinese currency also used to include the fen, corresponding to 0.1 jiao or 0.01 yuan. However, while the fen was long used, it disappeared from circulation because of its low value. Note that while the yuan is the official currency of China, it is not used in Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, which have their own currencies: The Hong Kong dollar (HKD$), The Macau pataca (MOP), The Taiwanese dollar (NT$). What are the coins and banknotes in Chinese currency? The currency in China consists of various coins and banknotes, ranging from 1 jiao to 100 yuan: There is little circulation of counterfeit currency in China, but it still happens, especially with banknotes. To verify the authenticity of a Chinese currency note, look in the light to see if the watermark of the People's Bank of China is present on the front of the note, on the left side. You can also run your finger over Mao's collar -- if it is rough, the note is genuine. Send money to China with Western Union How can you pay in China? There are several ways to pay in China: cash, bank

Why does China have two currencies? Why does China have two currencies? Chinese money has two names that are often used interchangeably. Read on to find out the key differences between CNH and CNY. Chinese money comes by two names: the Yuan (CNY) and the people's renminbi (RMB). Confusingly, both have the same bank notes, but, crucially, they are not worth the same. The difference comes in where the currency is settled and the hints come in the ISO codes for the currency; one is called the CNY and one the CNH. The former is used in the domestic economy and the latter for international trade. A brief history of China's currency China's currency is officially called the renminbi, meaning ""the people's currency"" in Mandarin, and the yuan is actually the unit of account. It was first issued by the People's Bank of China in 1948 and whilst the two terms are used interchangeably the relationship is similar to that of sterling and pounds in the UK. Back in the days before China was the industrial and economic behemoth that it is now, the Chinese economy was relatively closed and the conversion of international currency was heavily restricted. The Chinese government wanted to make sure that it held control of the money in the economy and to limit the amount of currency and wealth that could flow out of the country. Why China needs two currencies As China began to grow and become the beating heart of manufacturing and industrial work in the late 90s and 2000s, more and more money was flowing into the country from eager consumers, especially in the west. Creating a parallel currency, settled in China-Hong Kong, was the way that they decided to do it and banks were able to start trading the new CNH currency from 2004.

The IMF increased the weight of the yuan in its Special Drawing Rights basket in 2022, an international reserve asset that the IMF created as a supplement to member countries' official reserves. How Many Renminbi Are There in a Dollar? One USD is worth 7.25 Chinese yuan RMB as of June 24, 2024. How Much Is One Chinese Yuan Worth? One Chinese yuan is worth 13.7 U.S. cents as of June 24, 2024. How Do You Buy Digital Yuan? Only Chinese citizens can purchase digital yuan or e-CNY. It can be purchased through certain banks in select Chinese cities as well as through online payment services WeChat and Alipay. The Bottom Line The currency of China is referred to as either the Chinese yuan (CNY) or renminbi (RMB). The two terms are similar and they're often used interchangeably. The key difference is that the RMB is the official currency. The yuan is its principal unit of measurement.

Yuan vs. Renminbi: An Overview Chinese money is referred to by two names: the Chinese yuan (CNY) and renminbi (RMB), which translates to ""People's Currency."" The distinction between CNY and RMB is subtle. RMB is the official currency of China. The yuan is the principal unit of account for that currency. Chinese currency defines the economy of one of the world's biggest superpowers. It's also central to one of the most debated issues involving China: its perceived mercantilist policy of artificially undervaluing currency against the U.S. dollar. This is believed to give its exports an unfair price advantage. The yuan character is also used in the names of other currencies such as the New Taiwan Dollar and the Hong Kong Dollar. Yuan (CNY) The character yuan is used for round or circular things in Mandarin Chinese. This word was also used for the silver Spanish dollars introduced by European merchants in the 17th and 18th centuries. China began to mint its own silver yuan coins in 1889. Both the Qing Dynasty and early Republican government circulated silver yuan coins and banknotes. The traditional character for yuan is also used in the currencies of other Chinese-speaking regions in the 2020s including the New Taiwan Dollar and the Hong Kong Dollar. The modern-day Chinese Yuan uses the abbreviation CNY to distinguish between the mainland currency and other uses of the word. Forex brokers will quote prices with the ticker CNY. The largest banknote is 100 yuan, followed by 50 yuan, 20 yuan, 10 yuan, five yuan, and one yuan. One yuan can be further divided into jiao and fen. There are 10 jiao in a yuan, like dimes in a dollar, and 10 fen in a jiao. The word ""yuan"" is frequently used in Mandarin translations of foreign currencies. The U.S. dollar is translated as mei yuan. Renminbi (RMB) The People's Bank of China (PBOC) was established during the Chinese Civil War. It issued the first RMB notes in December 1948, about a year before the Chinese Communist Party defeated

Chinese Yuan Renminbi Currency CNY The Chinese yuan renminbi (simplified Chinese: Ren Min Bi ), or CNY, which means 'people's currency', is the official currency of the People's Republic of China. The term 'renminbi' refers to the name of the currency while 'yuan' refers to the basic unit of the Chinese currency. The symbol of the renminbi is Y=. As it is shared with the Japanese yen (JPY), CNY= is sometimes used to distinguish the Chinese yuan renminbi from the yen. The renminbi, introduced in 1948, is abbreviated as RMB but it is not an official currency code. Markets located in Hong Kong that trade the Chinese currency at free-floating rates use another unofficial code - CNH. The RMB acts as one of the most-held reserve currencies in the world, while being the eighth most-traded currency globally. In 1948, the first edition of the Chinese yuan renminbi was introduced by the People's Bank of China, with the RMB issued in banknotes only. In 1955, a revaluation happened, resulting in the introduction of the new yuan renminbi at the exchange rate of 1 new yuan to 10,000 old yuan. Since the 1950s, numerous series of the Chinese currency have been issued, having their own banknotes and coins. In 1978, the dual track currency system was implemented, with the Chinese yuan renminbi being used only domestically. Therefore foreigners had to use exchange certificates, which led to a strong black market. In the 1990s, the dual track currency system was abandoned. From 1997 to 2005, the Chinese currency was pegged to the US dollar at the exchange rate of approximately 1 USD to 8.3 CNY. Since 2006, the Chinese yuan renminbi has had a floating exchange rate. Trivia The word 'yuan' means 'round'. The 'redback' is a nickname for the Chinese yuan renminbi, similarly to the slang term for the US dollar - 'greenback'. China's central bank announced in 2019 that a digital renminbi, also called DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) was going to be released soon. However, China's",1,1,5,4

Likewise, Jenkins' participation in the Black Conventions in Ohio would have put him in contact with John Gaines and Peter Clarke. Finally, Jenkins' induction of Granville Woods into African Freemasonry would have given the younger man an immediate way into his new city's educational elite. Peter Clark, the unrelated Samuel Clark and William H. Parham were all leading freemasons and teachers in the segregated Colored Schools. Woods was embraced by the semi-secret society. Understanding Woods' personal life in Ohio is more problematic. In June 1880 he married a Sadie Turner; the marriage license report in the Cincinnati Star marked is his first appearance in Cincinnati. (Other news included the Democrats uniting for General Hancock in the convention national Convention meeting in Cincinnati; the Ohio Republican James Garfield would win the election in the fall.) The city directory the next year listed Sadie Woods, laundress, working at the southeast corner of Canal and Race as well as an ""S. Woods, engineer"" living at the same address. It's not clear whether those entries indicate the recently married couple or not. In 1882 Granville Woods makes his first unequivocal appearance in the directory, living on Fulton Street in the Fulton neighborhood on the near east side; there is no entry for Sadie although it was uncommon for wives to leave any evidence in the directories. We can follow Woods around various downtown neighborhoods in the annual Williams Directories between 1882 and 1891. His footprints in the community are a little light, but he made his way into the odd gossip column. There is no indication that he entered into any business relationships with Black Cincinnatians, but very few in the community had the sort of capital required to engage in serious manufacturing. In 1891, he was sued for divorce by an Ada Woods in the same city; some recent accounts assume that Ada and Sadie were the same woman.

Granville Tailer Woods (April 23, 1856 - January 30, 1910) was an inventor who held more than 60 patents in the U.S. He was the first African American mechanical and electrical engineer after the Civil War. Self-taught, he concentrated most of his work on trains and streetcars. One of his notable inventions was a device he called the Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph, a variation of induction telegraph which relied on ambient static electricity from existing telegraph lines to send messages between train stations and moving trains. His work assured a safer and better public transportation system for the cities of the United States. Contents Early life Granville T. Woods was born to Martha J. Brown and Cyrus Woods. He had a brother named Lyates. His mother was part Native American and his father was African American. Granville attended school in Columbus, Ohio until age 10, but had to leave due to his family's poverty, which meant he needed to work; he served an apprenticeship in a machine shop and learned the trades of machinist and blacksmith. Some sources of his day asserted that he also received two years of college-level training in ""electrical and mechanical engineering,"" but little is known about where he might have studied. Career In 1872, Woods obtained a job as a fireman on the Danville and Southern Railroad in Missouri. He eventually became an engineer, and in December 1874 moved to Springfield, Illinois, and worked at a rolling mill, the Springfield Iron Works. He studied mechanical and electrical engineering in college from 1876-1878. In 1878, he took a job aboard the steamer ""Ironsides"", and, within two years, became Chief Engineer. When he returned to Ohio, he became an engineer with the Dayton and Southwestern Railroad in southwestern Ohio. In 1880, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and established his business as an electrical engineer and an inventor. After receiving the multiplex telegraph patent, he reorganized his Cincinnati company as the

Biography Granville Tailer Woods was an American inventor who held more than fifty patents.[1] Granville T. Woods was born free in Columbus, Ohio, on 23 April 1856. He was the son of Tennessee born Cyrus Tailer Woods and Virgina born Martha Brown. In the 1860 census Granville (age 10) was in Martinsburg, Knox, Ohio, living with his parents and several inferred siblings.[2]In 1870 Granville was recorded living in Columbus, Ohio with his widowed mother, Martha, listed as a washer woman, and two inferred siblings. Granville's occupation was listed as Church Sexton. [3] In 1872, he went west and obtained work as a fireman and later as an engineer on an Iron Mountain Railroad in Missouri. In his spare time he studied electricity. In December 1874 he moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he worked in a rolling mill, until early 1876, when he went east to begin two years of college study in mechanical and electrical engineering, while also working in a machine shop. Beginning in 1878 he spent two years at sea as an engineer on a British steamship. During 1880 he handled a locomotive on the D & S Railroad. [4] In the 1880s he established a factory in Cincinnati, Ohio, for the manufacture of telephone, telegraph, and electrical instruments.[4] One of his most significant inventions was a system intended for the engineer of a train to know how close he was to other trains. This prevented accidents and collisions between trains. He also invented the induction telegraph system, it allowed messages to be sent to and from trains, which also help prevent collision. He and his brother organized Woods Electrical Company. The company prospered, as he was successful in selling his invention to some of the country's largest corporations. There were problems with train telegraphic equipment, but he later invented a train telegraph that did not depend on contact between the moving train and the conducting wire. In June of 1880 a marriage license was issued to Granville and Sadie Turner

he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and established his business as an electrical engineer and an inventor. After receiving the multiplex telegraph patent, he reorganized his Cincinnati company as the Woods Electric Co. In 1892 he moved his research operations to New York City, where he was joined by his brother, Lyates Woods, who also had several inventions. Although the newspapers of his day generally referred to him as a bachelor, Woods was married to Ada Woods who was granted a divorce from him in 1891. Granville T. Woods was often described as an articulate and well-spoken man, as meticulous and stylish in his choice of clothing, and as a man who preferred to dress in black. At times, he would refer to himself as an immigrant from Australia, in the belief that he would be given more respect if people thought he was from a foreign country, as opposed to being an African American. In his day, the black newspapers frequently expressed their pride in his achievements, saying he was ""the greatest of Negro inventors"", and sometimes even calling him ""professor"", although there is no evidence he ever received a college degree. Inventions Granville T. Woods invented and patented Tunnel Construction for the electric railroad system, and was referred to by some as the ""Black Edison"". Over the course of his lifetime Granville Woods obtained more than 50 patents for inventions including an automatic brake, an egg incubator, and for improvements to other technologies such as the safety circuit, telegraph, telephone, and phonograph. In 1884, Woods received his first patent for a steam boiler furnace, and in 1885, Woods patented an apparatus which was a combination of a telephone and a telegraph. The device, which he called ""telegraphony"", would allow a telegraph station to send voice and telegraph messages through Morse code over a single wire. He sold the rights to this device to the American Bell Telephone Company. In 1887, he patented the Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph

the sort of capital required to engage in serious manufacturing. In 1891, he was sued for divorce by an Ada Woods in the same city; some recent accounts assume that Ada and Sadie were the same woman. Another 1891 story in Cincinnati's Enquirer - a democratic newspaper unsympathetic to Blacks, free or freed - suggest a more complicated domestic life. At any rate, accounts of Woods' serious bout of smallpox while in Cincinnati - appearing in all places in patent litigation - refer to male acquaintances nursing him but make no mention of a wife. Apart from inventing, there is passing mention of Granville Woods in Cincinnati in a few articles during the 1880's. In good nineteenth-century fashion he gave lectures on electricity and magnetism in public forums in the city. One venue was the rather new YMCA (before there was a segregated Black Y), a common place for educational events. Yet Woods also lectured about his area of expertise in his own community. On one occasion he spoke in a Black Baptist Church downtown. In Walnut Hills, he gave a lecture/demonstration at Brown Chapel AME - already in the 1880's a well-established congregation. Brown Chapel was at the time a short block away the street from the Elm Street Colored School (later Frederick Douglass) in Walnut Hills. In 1887 a Black Baptist minister, teacher and college president in Lexington, Kentucky named William J. Simmons published Men of Mark, a collection of biographies of 172 leading African American men. It seems that Simmons lightly edited submissions by his subjects; one such man took this work as an opportunity to introduce himself as ""Granville T. Woods, Esq, Electrician - Mechanical - Engineer - Manufacturer of Telephone, Telegraph and Electrical Instruments."" Woods presented a neat chronology: born in Columbus, Ohio, 1856; went to work in a machine shop there 1866; 1872, moved to Missouri to work on a railroad and study electricity in his leisure time; 1874 moved to Illinois to work in a",1,1,5,5

He unexpectedly led a winning turnaround with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) during the 2011–12 season, sparking a cultural phenomenon known as ""Linsanity"". Lin was the first American of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, and is one of the few Asian Americans to have played in the league. He is the first Asian American player to win an NBA championship, having done so with the Toronto Raptors in 2019. Lin grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and earned Northern California Basketball Player of the Year honors as a senior in high school. After receiving no athletic scholarship offers, he attended Harvard University, where he was a three-time all-conference player in the Ivy League. Undrafted out of college, Lin signed with his hometown Golden State Warriors in 2010. He seldom played in his rookie season and received assignments to the NBA Development League (D-League). In 2011, Lin was waived by both the Warriors and the Houston Rockets before joining the New York Knicks early in 2011–12. At first, Lin played sparingly for the Knicks, and he again spent time in the D-League. In February 2012, however, he was promoted to the starting lineup and led the team on a seven-game winning streak. Lin's stellar play during the season helped the Knicks make the 2012 playoffs; it also catapulted him to international fame. Lin appeared on the covers of Sports Illustrated and Time and was named to the Time 100 as one of the most influential people in the world. In July 2012, Lin won the ESPY Award for Breakthrough Athlete of the Year. Following his Knicks tenure, Lin played for the Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers, Charlotte Hornets, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks, and Toronto Raptors. While he experienced some success in Houston and Charlotte, he battled

Lin played for the Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers, Charlotte Hornets, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks, and Toronto Raptors. While he experienced some success in Houston and Charlotte, he battled injuries in the ensuing seasons. In August 2019, he left the NBA and signed with the Beijing Ducks, where he became an All-Star in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). Attempting to return to the NBA, Lin played with the Warriors' development team in 2021. He returned to the CBA and played with the Ducks and later the Guangzhou Loong Lions. He left the Loong Lions midseason in 2022–23 and joined PLG's Steelers in 2023. == Early life == Lin was born to a Taiwanese American family in Torrance, California, on August 23, 1988. He was raised a Christian in the Bay Area city of Palo Alto, California. His parents, Gie-ming Lin and Shirley Lin (née Xinxin Wu), emigrated from Taiwan to the United States in the mid-1970s, first settling in Virginia before moving to Indiana, where they both attended universities to study engineering and computer science. They are dual nationals of Taiwan and the U.S. Lin's paternal family are Hoklo people from Beidou, Changhua, Taiwan, while his maternal grandmother emigrated to Taiwan in the late 1940s from Pinghu, Zhejiang in mainland China. Lin's parents are both 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall. His maternal grandmother's family was tall, and her father was over 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m). Lin has an older brother, Josh, and a younger brother, Joseph. Gie-Ming taught his sons to play basketball at the local YMCA. Shirley helped form a National Junior Basketball program in Palo Alto where Lin played. She worked with coaches to ensure his playing did not affect his academic performance. She was criticized by her friends for letting Lin play so much basketball, but let him play the game he enjoyed. During his senior year in 2005–06, Lin captained Palo Alto High School to a 32–1 record and upset the nationally ranked Mater Dei, 51–47, for the

Jordan's reign was overall disappointing. In 13 seasons under his leadership, the team went 423-600, made just three playoff appearances and did not win a single series. During the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, the then-Bobcats went 7-59, which is the worst record in NBA history -- both in terms of fewest wins and lowest winning percentage. One of the few memorable accomplishments during the Jordan era was reclaiming the Hornets' name and original franchise records and history. Last season, the Hornets went 27-55, which was the fourth-worst record in the league. They won the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and used it to select Brandon Miller out of Alabama. That was a slightly controversial choice with Scoot Henderson still on the board, but regardless the Hornets will go into the future with an interesting young duo in Miller and LaMelo Ball.

28,what is arkansas state capitol?,Little Rock,Little Rock,"The Louisiana State Capitol (French: Capitole de l'État de Louisiane) is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Louisiana and is located in downtown Baton Rouge. The capitol houses the chambers for the Louisiana State Legislature, made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the office of the Governor of Louisiana. At 450 feet (137 m) tall and with 34 stories, it is the tallest skyscraper in Baton Rouge, the seventh tallest building in Louisiana, and tallest capitol in the United States. It is located on a 27-acre (110,000 m2) tract, which includes the capitol gardens. The Louisiana State Capitol is often thought of as ""Huey Long's monument"" due to the influence of the former Governor and U.S. Senator in getting the capitol built. The building's construction was completed in 1931. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982. == History == In order to secure the mouth of the Mississippi River for the French, the town of New Orleans was founded in 1718 and became the capital for colony of Louisiana in 1722. In 1763, the Treaty of Paris ceded the portion of Louisiana that was west of the Mississippi River, as well as New Orleans, to Spain and the remaining territory east of the Mississippi was turned over to Great Britain. The French reclaimed Louisiana from the Spanish in 1803 after the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800; the territory was then sold as the Louisiana Purchase to the United States. The ceremonial transfers of Louisiana from Spain to France in November 1803 took place in front of the colonial seat of government, the Cabildo. The transfer from France to the U.S. occurred there as well less than a month later. New Orleans continued to be the location of the capital of the Territory of Orleans, and through its admission into the U.S. as the state of Louisiana. The State Legislature passed a resolution declaring that the seat of government be moved to a

The Minnesota State Capitol is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Minnesota, in its capital city of Saint Paul. It houses the Minnesota Senate, Minnesota House of Representatives, the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Governor. The building also includes a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court, although court activities usually take place in the neighboring Minnesota Judicial Center. There have been three State Capitol buildings. The present building was designed by architect Cass Gilbert and completed in 1905. Its Beaux-Arts/American Renaissance design was influenced by the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and by McKim, Mead & White's Rhode Island State House. From 2013 to 2017 the building underwent an extensive restoration. This included replacing existing infrastructure; adding new mechanical systems; replacing or repairing tens of thousands of pieces of marble on the exterior; cleaning historic paintings, murals, and sculptures; and adding safety and accessibility features. The building is set in a landscaped campus with the Capitol Mall on its south front, Leif Erikson Park on its west, and Judicial Plaza to its east. Various monuments and memorials are located in these green spaces. == History == === First Minnesota State Capitol === The current State Capitol building is the third building to serve this purpose. The territorial legislature first met in a temporary headquarters in the Central House Hotel. In 1851, work began to oversee finances and the hiring of contractors to build the Capitol. Its architect, N. C. Prentiss drew up specifications for the new Capitol. Exterior details included brick work, cut stone floors and steps for the porches, a wood pediment, wood Ionic-style columns, and a well-framed roof covered with fireproof material. Interior work called for Norway pine flooring and staircases of oak and ash with oak handrails and turned balusters. The legislature moved into the new Capitol in time for

capital of the Territory of Orleans, and through its admission into the U.S. as the state of Louisiana. The State Legislature passed a resolution declaring that the seat of government be moved to a ""more convenient place"" than New Orleans. No action was taken until 1829 when the Legislature voted to move to Donaldsonville. It convened for the first time in Donaldsonville in January 1830. On January 8, 1831, it became ""dissatisfied with the quarters there"", and adjourned shortly thereafter to return to New Orleans. === Old State Capitol === Included in the Louisiana State Constitution of 1845 was a clause that required the state capital to be moved from New Orleans by 1849. A committee was formed to prepare a site for the eventual move and, the designs by James H. Dakin were chosen in a competition on May 5, 1847. The city of Baton Rouge donated a plot of land situated on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River to the state on September 7 for the construction of the new capitol. Dakin's design for the capitol consisted of a ""castellated"" Gothic Revival building, a rarity for government buildings in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on December 1, 1849 in what was planned to be a grand ceremony. However, a devastating fire in Baton Rouge a week prior saw the funds reallocated as aid for the victims, which was deemed a ""more worthy cause"". The Old State Capitol is considered the best example of Gothic Revival architecture in the South, although it was notably criticized by Mark Twain, who called it an ""architectural falsehood"" due to its cod-medieval appearance (which he attributed to the influence of Sir Walter Scott). With the start of the Civil War in 1861, and the occupation of both New Orleans and Baton Rouge by the Union Army, the location of the state government was moved to Opelousas in 1862, and then to Shreveport in 1864. The portion of Louisiana that was occupied by Union troops was governed out of New Orleans. The vacant Old State Capitol was

with fireproof material. Interior work called for Norway pine flooring and staircases of oak and ash with oak handrails and turned balusters. The legislature moved into the new Capitol in time for the 5th territorial legislative session on January 4, 1854. The population boomed after Minnesota became a state on May 11, 1858, and the Capitol building was expanded with a new wing on the Exchange Street side of the building in 1873 and a second wing facing Wabasha Street in 1878. Despite efforts to make the Capitol fire-resistant, it was destroyed by fire on March 1, 1881. While legislators met in the evening, fire broke out in the dome of the Capitol and quickly spread. There were no deaths, but efforts to save the building failed. It was replaced on the same site in 1883 by the second Capitol building. === Second Minnesota State Capitol === After fire destroyed Minnesota's first Capitol building, the second Capitol, a three-story, Romanesque, masonry building designed by Leroy Buffington, was completed in 1883 on the site of the first Capitol. Buffington designed the new building in the shape of a Greek cross. It featured a foundation of cut stone and walls of red brick with Dresbach sandstone trim. Each wing measured 150 feet in length. The main entrance on the southwest from Wabasha Street opened onto the first floor, where the governor, attorney general, auditor, treasurer, and secretary of state had offices. The Assembly (House of Representatives) chamber in the southeast wing featured a twenty-five-foot ceiling with a large stained glass skylight. The Senate chamber in the southwest wing was finished in yellow birch and birdseye maple. The Supreme Court chamber in the southeast wing featured woodwork of cherry and Hungarian ash. Shortly after it opened, deficiencies of the new building were becoming clear. Overcrowding due to a lack of space, a lack of adequate fireproofing, and the discovery of dry rot made the building increasing unacceptable. Additionally,

government was moved to Opelousas in 1862, and then to Shreveport in 1864. The portion of Louisiana that was occupied by Union troops was governed out of New Orleans. The vacant Old State Capitol was originally used as a prison by the Union Army and, then, as a garrison for its colored troops. On December 28, 1862, it was gutted by an accidental fire. After the war, the state government retu",1,1,5,1
29,what language do serbs speak?,Serbian,Serbian language,"What are the Top 5+ Languages in Serbia? Is your language spoken in Serbia? There's a high possibility it is! And we're not talking about the fact that most young Serbians speak English. But for start, let's say something about the official languages in Serbia. The official language in Serbia is, of course, Serbian. The official script is the Cyrillic. The Latin script is also widely recognized. Nowadays, youth use the Latin script even more than Cyrillic because of its international character (and because of easier typing and switching to English keyboard). Can you guess how many minority languages there are in Serbia? There are fifteen of them! Minority languages in Serbia are in official use in parts of the country where the percentage of that particular minority exceeds 15%. The newest introduced minority language in Serbia is Bunjevac. It happened two years ago, in 2021. Bunjevac became the fourth official language in the northest Serbian town, Subotica. It means every street title sign in Subotica has to be written in four languages! The first name is in Serbian, then Hungarian, Croatian, and Bunjevac. The interesting thing is that Serbian, Croatian, and Bunjevac are languages so similar that you'd have to try hard not to understand the other two if you speak one of them. It seems funny, but for people from this town, it's a normal multicultural thing, where everyone's background is equally respected. Anyway, we went too far from our initial question. So, what are the top languages in Serbia? Let's find out! Can you guess the top three languages spoken in Serbia? Serbian Okay, this one was obvious, but we had to point it out. Of course, the official language of Serbia is Serbian. So, it is the most widely spoken language in the country. English Another safe bet. English is not a minority language in Serbia for obvious reasons of the English-speaking minority being inexistent. However, if you're visiting Serbia as a tourist and don't speak Serbian - English is

from the same class take every lesson together. Anyway, let's learn about Slavic languages in Serbia! Is your mother tongue one of the minority languages in Serbia? Other Slavic languages Other Slavic languages widely spoken in Serbia can be divided into two groups: the languages that fell into the Serbo-Croatian language in ex-Yugoslavia, and other Slavic languages. After Yugoslavia fell apart, every ex-republic wanted their language, just like they had their own nation. So, instead of one language (Serbo-Croatian), we now have Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. These four languages are the same in a linguistic context, but politically and officially separate. So, if you speak Serbian, you'll understand Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin perfectly. Maybe you'll miss a word here and there, but the differences aren't bigger than those of the Serbian dialects in the northern and southern parts of Serbia. Bunjevac is the closest to Serbian. We won't go into the linguistic history, but the Old Slavic language had one sound that turned into different sounds in different languages. While it gave e in Serbian, it gave i in Bunjevac. It doesn't mean that you should change every e in Serbian to get the Bunjevac language, but you can do it in some words. For example, while in Serbian we say, Mleko for milk, in Bunjevac, the same word will sound, Mliko. While Serbs and Macedonians can understand each other if they put in a bit of effort, other Slavic languages in Serbia aren't that similar to the official one? Bulgarian is the next closest to Serbian, but you'd have to speak Serbian perfectly and understand Slavic linguistics if you'd like to talk with a Bulgarian effortlessly. For other Slavic languages, you'll need language lessons! Albanian Albanian is widely spoken in Southern Serbia since most Albanians live in the Southern part of the country. Unfortunately, we don't have the exact data about the number of Albanian speakers in Serbia because of political

Serbian (српски / srpski, pronounced [sr̩̂pskiː]) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian language mainly used by Serbs. It is the official and national language of Serbia, one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and co-official in Montenegro and Kosovo. It is a recognized minority language in Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Standard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian (more specifically on the dialects of Šumadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovina), which is also the basis of standard Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin varieties and therefore the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Montenegrins was issued in 2017. The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia, which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian. Serbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić, who created it based on phonemic principles. The Latin alphabet used for Serbian (latinica) was designed by the Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in the 1830s based on the Czech system with a one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correlation between the Cyrillic and Latin orthographies, resulting in a parallel system. == Classification == Serbian is a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian, a Slavic language (Indo-European), of the South Slavic subgroup. Other standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian are Bosnian, Croatian, and Montenegrin. ""An examination of all the major 'levels' of language shows that BCS is clearly a single language with a single grammatical system."" It has lower intelligibility with the Eastern South Slavic languages Bulgarian and Macedonian, than with Slovene (Slovene is part of the Western South Slavic subgroup, but there are still significant

Background Information (Serbian) About The language continuum known as Serbo-Croatian was the most widely spoken language in the former Yugoslavia, at its peak counting as many as 20 million speakers. Culturally, Yugoslavia's eastern region -- consisting of present-day Serbia, Montenegro and parts of Bosnia and Hercegovina -- was separated both religiously and linguistically from its western region consisting of present-day Croatia and parts of Bosnia and Hercegovina. As a result, the Serbian and Croatian official languages as they exist today are based on distinct dialects and are written with different alphabets, although because of their close similarity, some still consider the languages as a unit called 'Serbo-Croatian.' Because of their shared development, portions of this profile must refer to Croatian, as well as Serbian. Today Serbian is spoken by a total of over 11 million speakers. Serbian's geographical center is the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia where there more than 10 million speakers. In addition there are large numbers of Serbian speakers in the U.S.A. and Canada. Smaller communities of Serbian speakers, numbering in the low tens of thousands, are found in Hungary, Romania, Albania and Russia. Linguistic Affiliation Serbian is a member of the Slavic branch of Indo-European languages. Other Slavic languages include Russian, Polish and Ukrainian. Serbian is a part of the South Slavic sub-group of Slavic. Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Slovene are also South Slavic languages. Language Variation One major dialectal division which covers the entire Serbian and Croatian territory is based on which modern day vowel is pronounced in place of the old vowel jat'. There are three variants, but on the Serbian territory only two are found; these dialects are known as Ekavian and Ijekavian (the third variant, Ikavian, is found only in Croatia). The most widely spoken of these dialects is Ekavian, which forms the basis for standard Serbian. Ekavian is spoken in most

is not a minority language in Serbia for obvious reasons of the English-speaking minority being inexistent. However, if you're visiting Serbia as a tourist and don't speak Serbian - English is the way to go. We may have a negligible number of native English speakers living in Serbia. But if you're trying to communicate with locals without the knowledge of Serbian, there's a high chance they know English. English is our second language in school. We start learning it from a very young age. However, don't be surprised if the generation of 1970s and older don't speak English. They mostly learned German and French during their school days. So, try to find people younger than 40 or 45 when asking for directions in English. If you're better in German, stick with those of 50 years or older. Hungarian We finally came to our first minority language in Serbia! Hungary is Serbia's northern neighbor, so it makes sense that most (almost all) Hungarians in Serbia live in our northern province - Vojvodina. Vojvodina was historically a part of Hungary, although many Serbs lived there. After WWI, in November of 1918, Vojvodina joined Serbia. Kingdom Yugoslavia was formed in the same year. Hungarians in Serbia, like other minorities, can school their children in their native language. It means that every school in every town where Hungarian is a minority language has one or more classes where all subjects are taught in Hungarian. The only difference is that they have an extra subject since the children get a grade from both - their mother tongue and Serbian. If this seems confusing, let us explain. A class in Serbia isn't the same as in the USA. All subjects are the same and mandatory. So, it's impossible to attend advanced math with certain people, and English with others. All children from the same class take every lesson together. Anyway, let's learn about Slavic languages in Serbia! Is your mother tongue one of the minority languages in Serbia?

Most of the newer coins are gold-colored, except for the 5 and 10 colones coins, which are silver. Expect little difficulty when it comes to exchanging money in Costa Rica. All banks will exchange US dollars and many will exchange British pounds or euros. Travelers checks can be cashed at banks or exchange bureaus for a commission of 1% to 3%. Some hotels accept travelers checks for payment, but many do not. ATMs (known as cajeros automaticos) are widely available in Costa Rica. Some banks charge a fee for using an ATM abroad, so check with your bank before traveling to Costa Rica. Credit cards are widely accepted at midrange and upscale hotels and restaurants. Most credit cards include a transaction fee for international purchases. Credit cards are widely accepted throughout the country, but there will still be occasions when only cash will do. We recommend reading our article ""Are Credit Cards Accepted?"" to learn when and where credit and debit cards are appropriate. This article will also help you better determine how much cash you may need throughout your trip. Taxes and Tipping There is a 13% tax on all purchases in Costa Rica, including souvenirs, food, and hotels. Hotels add an additional 3% tourist surcharge and most restaurants include a 10% gratuity fee. You are not obligated to tip on top of this, but it's good practice to do so, because the 10% fee is split among many people. If you want to tip your waiter directly, leave more money on the table. You may want to tip other people while in Costa Rica, including maids, bellhops, or drivers. Tips for these services usually range from US$1 to US$10 a day. Taxi drivers do not expect a tip.

only thing you need to worry about during your holiday in Costa Rica is enjoying yourself. Not only is the Costa Rican government stable, the nation is known as the most stable country in Central and Latin America. This stability carries over into Costa Rica's economy; you will have no difficulty accessing money in Costa Rica upon your arrival or departure. Practical Matters US dollars are widely accepted in Costa Rica, especially at upscale hotels and restaurants--some places even list their prices in US dollars to make it easier for international travelers. For smaller services (including local meals or public transportation), be prepared to pay with colones. Costs Budget travelers can survive on around US$30 to US$40 a day. This covers basic transportation, lodging, and food. Rooms in budget hotels usually run around US$10 to US$20 per person and may include private or shared bathrooms. Meals at local restaurants (called sodas) usually go for around US$3 to US$4. Midrange travelers usually spend US$50 to US$100 per person per day. Hotels in this range are more comfortable and offer a good list of amenities; these usually go for around US$30 to US$80 a night. Restaurants in this category offer meals for US$5 to US$10. High-end travelers will find a number of upscale hotels and restaurants in Costa Rica. Nicer hotels start at around US$90 and are often found in more developed areas, although there are some impressive eco-lodges in remote destinations. Meals at the best restaurants begin at around US$20. Hotels are generally more expensive during the dry season (December to April) and holidays, including Christmas, New Years, and Semana Santa. Banks, ATMs and Money Colones come in paper denominations of 1.000, 2.000, 5.000, 10.000, 20.000, and 50.000. Coins come in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500. Older coins are silver and slightly larger than the newer versions. Most of the newer coins are gold-colored, except for the 5 and 10 colones coins, which are

$10 and $20 bills. The bills will need to be in good condition as they will not be accepted if they are ripped or torn. The larger the bill, the more perfect it needs to be. Bills larger than $20 are difficult and might have to be changed at a bank. You will most likely receive your change in the local currency: colones. Euros are not widely accepted in Costa Rica. Exchanging US Dollars To Costa Rican Money When you arrive, you may exchange your money for official currency at any local bank. Some upscale hotels will also exchange money for their guests. Note that you will get a more favorable exchange rate from banks. Do not exchange money inside the airport. You'll see money changing kiosks as soon as you exit the baggage claim area, but it's best to walk right past it. The exchange rate at the kiosks in the Costa Rica airports is notoriously terrible. You can also exchange money at your own bank in your home country for a good rate. They will just have to order the colones, so plan on exchanging your money a few weeks ahead of time. Travel Tip: If you are making a smaller purchase at a local convenient store or soda, try not to pay with large colones bill. For example, if you want to buy a Casado for 2,500 colones, try not to us a 20,000 colones bill. Ticos tend to get annoyed because they don't want to break that much change. Although if you are insistent, they will usually help you. Travel Tip: Most places accept credit and debt cards. Just check with your bank about any possible fee you might have to pay to use your card internationally. Travel Tip: Leave your travelers checks at home. They are not as widely accepted as cash or credit cards. The main color of the 1,000 colones banknote is red.

You may get local colones using your ATM card. It's important that you know the exchange rate before you do this. You should check with your bank regarding their policy for foreign ATMs, fees, limitations, etc. Local ATM's fees will vary, just like at home. Be mindful when using ATMs and make sure that you are in a safe area. Some ATMs will let you withdraw dollars, but not all of them. Credit Cards Credit cards are widely accepted by most businesses in Costa Rica. Contact your credit card providers to let them know you are traveling and ask them if any foreign transaction fees apply. Sometimes you will get a better price paying in cash rather than use a card, especially when you are negotiating.

Every year more people come to visit this little country for its natural beauty and eco-friendly attitude. Those who travel on a shoestring budget can survive on $50 a day. Top-notch hotels can charge up to $500 or more. Prices of luxury hotels and tours are in dollars, and dollars are widely accepted, but it is useful to have some Colones on hand. Shopping in Costa Rica Shopping for clothes and food in Costa Rica is not as cheap as you might expect. Most prices are actually similar to prices in the US or UK. Clothes, in particular, are expensive in Costa Rica. Supermarkets now offer a wider selection of local and imported food and a good selection of wine. It is significantly more costly than in the US, especially for imported items. Shopping in the center of San Jose, like at the Central Market on Avenida Central, is cheaper than in the flashy Malls of the Suburbs, and this is also where you will find typical artisans and souvenirs. The most economical places to shop for fresh foods, meats, fish fruits, and vegetables are at outdoor ferias (farmer's markets). They are usually open in the",1,1,5,5
31,when did the libyan conflict start?,2011,2011,"In early 2011, amid a wave of popular protest in countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa, largely peaceful demonstrations against entrenched regimes brought quick transfers of power in Egypt and Tunisia. In Libya, however, an uprising against the four-decade rule of Muammar al-Qaddafi led to civil war and international military intervention. In this special feature, Britannica provides a guide to recent events in Libya and explores the historical and geographic context of the conflict. Uprising On February 15, 2011, anti-government rallies were held in Benghazi by protesters angered by the arrest of a human rights lawyer, Fethi Tarbel. The protesters called for Qaddafi to step down and for the release of political prisoners. Libyan security forces used water cannons and rubber bullets against the crowds, resulting in a number of injuries. To counter the demonstrations further, a pro-government rally orchestrated by the Libyan authorities was broadcast on state television. As the protests intensified, with demonstrators taking control of Benghazi and unrest spreading to Tripoli, the Libyan government began using lethal force against demonstrators. Security forces and squads of mercenaries fired live ammunition into crowds of demonstrators. Demonstrators also were attacked with tanks and artillery and from the air with warplanes and helicopter gunships. The regime restricted communications, blocking the Internet and interrupting telephone service throughout the country. On February 21 one of Qaddafi's sons, Sayf al-Islam, gave a defiant address on state television, blaming outside agitators for the unrest and saying that further demonstrations could lead to civil war in the country. He vowed that the regime would fight ""to the last bullet."" The government's sudden escalation of violence against protesters and other civilians drew international condemnation from foreign leaders and human rights organizations. It also seemed to damage the coherence of the

Abdullah Doma/AFP/Getty Images More than a decade after a U.S.-backed intervention toppled Libya's authoritarian leader in 2011, political divisions and cascading security crises continue to threaten Libya's stability. After a 2020 cease-fire ended the country's six-year civil war between rival political factions, a UN-supported process led to the formation of a Government of National Unity

The Chadian–Libyan War was a series of military campaigns in Chad between 1978 and 1987, fought between Libyan and allied Chadian forces against Chadian groups supported by France, with the occasional involvement of other foreign countries and factions. Libya had been involved in Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before Muammar Gaddafi's rise to power in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the Chadian Civil War to northern Chad in 1968. The conflict was marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980–1981 and 1983–1987. On all of these occasions, Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the French government, which intervened militarily to support the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986. The pattern of the war delineated itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed the bulk of the scouting and fighting. This pattern was radically changed in 1986, towards the end of the war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity never previously witnessed in Chad. This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now by the United States, Zaire and France with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in air and other firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict. Gaddafi initially intended to annex the Aouzou Strip, the northernmost part of Chad, which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period. In 1972 his goals became, in the evaluation of historian Mario Azevedo, the creation of a client state in Libya's ""underbelly"", an

equipped, were largely able to repel. Most fighting took place in the towns around Tripoli and in the central coastal region, where rebels and Qaddafi loyalists battled for control of the oil-export terminals on the Gulf of Sidra. As the fighting continued, forces loyal to Qaddafi seemed to gain momentum, launching successful assaults to retake control in strategic areas around Tripoli and on the coast of the Gulf of Sidra. Attacking with fighter jets, tanks, and artillery, pro-Qaddafi forces had by March 10 driven rebel forces from Zawiyah, west of Tripoli, and from the oil-export centre of Ras Lanuf. Those gains highlighted the Qaddafi loyalists' advantages in weaponry, training, and organization. As Qaddafi appeared to gain the upper hand, the international community continued to debate possible diplomatic and military responses to the rapidly developing conflict. Countries worked to establish contact with the TNC, although only France granted it official recognition, announcing on March 10 that it would treat the council as Libya's legitimate government. International condemnation of the Qaddafi regime continued to build, and, at an emergency summit on March 11, the EU unanimously called for Qaddafi to step down. However, the international community remained divided over the possibility of military intervention--most likely by imposing a no-fly zone over Libya, a measure long requested by the rebels to prevent Qaddafi loyalists from launching air attacks. Some countries, including France and the United Kingdom, signaled their support for such an operation, while others, including the United States and Germany, expressed their reservations, emphasizing the need for broad international consensus and warning against possible unforeseen consequences of military intervention. The African Union (AU) rejected any military intervention in Libya, asserting that the crisis should be resolved through negotiations, whereas the Arab League passed a resolution on March 13

a coalition called Libya Dawn. Eventually, fighting broke out at Tripoli's international airport between the Libya Dawn coalition, which controlled Tripoli and much of western Libya, and the Dignity coalition, which controlled parts of Cyrenaica and Benghazi in eastern Libya, escalating the conflict into a full-fledged civil war. The battle for control over Libya crosses tribal, regional, political, and religious lines. Each coalition has created governing institutions and named military chiefs--and each has faced internal fragmentation and division. To find a resolution to the conflict and establish a unity government, then-UN Special Envoy to Libya Bernardino Leon, followed by Martin Kobler, facilitated a series of talks between the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR)--based in Libya's east and a key supporter of Haftar--and the Tripoli-based GNC. The talks resulted in the creation of the Libyan Political Agreement [PDF] and the UN-supported Government of National Accord (GNA) in December 2015. However, the GNA faced obstacles to creating a stable, unified government in Libya. Taking advantage of the widespread political instability, armed Islamist groups, including Ansar al-Sharia--the terrorist group allegedly responsible for the attack on the U.S. consulate in 2012--and the Islamic State, have used the country as a hub to coordinate broader regional violence, further complicating efforts to create a unity government. After seizing territory [PDF] in Benghazi, Derna, and Ajdabiya, the Islamic State's power in Libya peaked in 2016 when it captured the coastal city of Sirte--formerly the group's most significant stronghold outside of Syria and Iraq. While in control, its members committed numerous human rights abuses for which they now face trial in Libya. In July 2018, Haftar announced that the LNA had recaptured the city of Derna, the last outpost of the Islamic State militants in eastern Libya. However, the group continues to operate throughout the",5,1,5,4
32,who plays edward scissorhands?,Johnny Depp,Johnny Depp,"Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American gothic romantic fantasy film directed by Tim Burton. It was produced by Burton and Denise Di Novi, written by Caroline Thompson from a story by her and Burton, and starring Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin. It tells the story of an unfinished artificial humanoid who has scissor blades instead of hands, is taken in by a suburban family, and falls in love with their teenage daughter. Burton conceived Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros. declined. Edward Scissorhands was then fast-tracked after Burton's critical and financial success with Batman. The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman, and was Vincent Price's last film role to be released in his lifetime. Edward Scissorhands was a critical and commercial success, grossing over four times its $20 million budget. The film won the British Academy Film Award for Best Production Design and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, in addition to receiving multiple nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and the Saturn Awards. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work. == Plot == One snowy evening, an elderly woman tells her granddaughter the bedtime story of a young man named Edward, who has scissor blades for hands. Many years earlier, Peg Boggs, a local door-to-door Avon saleswoman, not having any luck in her own neighborhood, tries to sell at the decrepit Gothic mansion where Edward lives. The creation of an old inventor, Edward is an ageless humanoid. The inventor homeschooled Edward but died from a heart attack before giving Edward hands, leaving him unfinished.

and composer Elfman to go along. The work, which Bourne choreographed, was developed as dance theatre instead of as a traditional musical and has no singing or speaking. The musical score is by Terry Davies, but it includes significant portions of Elfman's film score. Thompson claims Scissorhands is based on a pet dog of hers. She described her dog as follows: ""She was the most soulful, yearning creature I ever met. She wanted to participate in everything. She didn’t need language to communicate. She communicated with her eyes."" She described the character as similar to Frankenstein's monster and Pinocchio in the sense that he is ""an outsider who wants to be an insider"". == Plot == The work ""tells the gothic story of a boy, created by an eccentric inventor, trying to adapt to suburban life with only scissors for hands."" The dance version is set in the 1950s, unlike the 1990 film, which was set in the late 1980s. An inventor's son was electrocuted in a dungeon-like room while holding scissors. In his grief, the inventor creates another ""son"" with flashing scissors for hands. The creation is orphaned when unsavory characters frighten his father to death with some Halloween activities. He then ventures from his gothic origins into a suburban town where his loneliness is reinforced until he is taken in by Peg Boggs and adopted by both her family and the town. In the promotional video for the American debut, Bourne highlights the juxtaposition of the gothic horror setting and the suburban settings of the adaptation. He also notes that San Francisco was a good place for the United States debut of the work in part because as a city it exhibits a tolerance similar to that of the suburbanites in the work. The piece has no spoken words. Like in the film, Edward is equipped with only scissors for hands because his inventor died in the middle of outfitting him. He is discovered in his castle by an Avon lady who brings him into her home. He then wanders into a town where a

Edward Scissorhands is a contemporary dance adaptation of the 1990 American romance fantasy film Edward Scissorhands, created by Matthew Bourne, with music by Terry Davies. The screenwriter and composer of the film version, Caroline Thompson and Danny Elfman, helped to develop the dance version, which is set in the 1950s (the film is set in the late 1980s). The story is told entirely through music and dance with no discourse although the plot is similar to the movie. The piece debuted in London in 2005 and, despite mixed reviews, has subsequently toured in Britain, Asia, the U.S. (earning a 2007 Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience), Australia and Europe. The productions have been put on by Bourne's New Adventures dance company. == Composition and development == Bourne's all-male 1995 version of Swan Lake has become the longest-running ballet production and earned him the distinction as the only British director to become a winner of both the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Choreography at the 53rd Tony Awards in 1999. In 2002, 2003 and 2005, he earned the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Theatre Choreographer for My Fair Lady, Play Without Words and Mary Poppins, respectively. Eventually (in 2008), Time would begin an article on Bourne with the following summary: ""Matthew Bourne is the world's most popular living dance maker."" Bourne was asked by composer friends to brainstorm about films that could be adapted into stage productions in his dance style. Thompson met Bourne in 1997 through Alan Cumming after already having seen Swan Lake. Bourne asked Thompson's consent to adapt the Scissorhands film the following year, but it took another seven years to obtain the necessary funding and get the film's director Tim Burton and composer Elfman to go along. The work, which Bourne choreographed, was developed as dance theatre instead of as a traditional musical and has no singing or speaking. The musical score is by Terry

where Edward lives. The creation of an old inventor, Edward is an ageless humanoid. The inventor homeschooled Edward but died from a heart attack before giving Edward hands, leaving him unfinished. Peg finds Edward alone and offers to take him to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Edward falls in love with Kim, despite her initial fear of him. As their neighbors are curious about the new houseguest, the Boggs throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming him. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's supercilious boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries, progressing to grooming dogs and later styling the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon so he can support himself. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce him, but scares him away. Joyce lies to the neighborhood women that Edward forced himself on her, reducing their trust in him. Edward's dream of opening the salon is ruined when the bank refuses him a loan on the grounds that he has no assessment and collateral and is not legally a human. Jealous of Kim's attraction to Edward, Jim takes advantage of his naivety by asking him to pick the lock on his parents' home so he can steal his father's electronic goods and sell them to buy a van. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered and walls come down, trapping Edward inside. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that a lifetime of isolation has left Edward without any common sense or morality; thus, he cannot be criminally charged. Edward nevertheless takes responsibility for the robbery, telling Kim that he did it because she asked him to. Consequently, he is shunned by the entire

No, the seven-time All-Star doesn't need to study again after a decorated baseball career spanning more than a decade. He wants to do it. The retired San Francisco Giants catcher has a year's worth of online coursework remaining to complete his degree in social science at Florida State, yet he plans to spread the work over two years given his busy home life with four children. School started Monday. Posey had been a finance major before being drafted by San Francisco fifth overall in 2008, but since he can't finish that path remotely, he will study social science, with his current studies including a class focused on sports and society. ""So I'm kind of in somewhat of my realm that I lived the last 15 years or so since I took a class,"" Posey said. He expects the degree will take more time given the demands of having twin toddler girls Ada and Livvi and another set of twins -- daughter Addison and son Lee -- who are now preteens.

34,what is the name of king george vi wife?,Queen Elizabeth VIII,Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,"George VI (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death in 1952. He was also the last Emperor of India from 1936 until the British Raj was dissolved in August 1947, and the first head of the Commonwealth following the London Declaration of 1949. The future George VI was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria; he was named Albert at birth after his great-grandfather Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was known as ""Bertie"" to his family and close friends. His father ascended the throne as George V in 1910. As the second son of the king, Albert was not expected to inherit the throne. He spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Edward, the heir apparent. Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stutter, which he learned to manage to some degree. His elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936, but Edward abdicated later that year to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. As heir presumptive to Edward VIII, Albert became king, taking the regnal name George VI. In September 1939, the British Empire and most Commonwealth countries—but not Ireland—declared war on Nazi Germany, following the invasion of Poland. War with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George VI was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George

George V (George Frederick Ernest Albert; 3 June 1865 – 20 January 1936) was King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India, from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936. George was born during the reign of his paternal grandmother, Queen Victoria, as the second son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). He was third in the line of succession to the British throne behind his father and his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor. From 1877 to 1892, George served in the Royal Navy, until his elder brother's unexpected death in January 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. The next year George married his brother's former fiancée, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, and they had six children. When Queen Victoria died in 1901, George's father ascended the throne as Edward VII, and George was created Prince of Wales. He became king-emperor on his father's death in 1910. George's reign saw the rise of socialism, communism, fascism, Irish republicanism, and the Indian independence movement, all of which radically changed the political landscape of the British Empire, which itself reached its territorial peak by the beginning of the 1920s. The Parliament Act 1911 established the supremacy of the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords. As a result of the First World War (1914–1918), the empires of his first cousins Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany fell, while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor, which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment. He appointed the first Labour ministry in 1924, and the 1931 Statute of Westminster recognised the Empire's Dominions as separate, independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations. George suffered from smoking-related health problems during his later reign. On his death in

people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. Britain and its allies were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had largely broken away, followed by the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died at Sandringham House, aged 56, of a coronary thrombosis. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II. == Early life == Albert was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), was the eldest child and only daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been ""rather distressed"". Two days later, he wrote again: ""I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her."" The Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: ""I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good."" Consequently, he was baptised

the Empire's Dominions as separate, independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations. George suffered from smoking-related health problems during his later reign. On his death in January 1936, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VIII. Edward abdicated in December of that year and was succeeded by his younger brother Albert, who took the regnal name George VI. == Early life and education == George was born on 3 June 1865, in Marlborough House, London. He was the second son of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and Alexandra, Princess of Wales. His father was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and his mother was the eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark. He was baptised at Windsor Castle on 7 July 1865 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Longley. As a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was little expectation that George would become king. He was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, Prince Albert Victor. George was only 17 months younger than Albert Victor, and the two princes were educated together. John Neale Dalton was appointed as their tutor in 1871. Neither Albert Victor nor George excelled intellectually. As their father thought that the navy was ""the very best possible training for any boy"", in September 1877, when George was 12 years old, both brothers joined the cadet training ship HMS Britannia at Dartmouth, Devon. For three years from 1879, the princes served on HMS Bacchante, accompanied by Dalton. They toured the colonies of the British Empire in the Caribbean, South Africa and Australia, and visited Norfolk, Virginia, as well as South America, the Mediterranean, Egypt, and East Asia. In 1881 on a visit to Japan, George had a local artist tattoo a blue and red dragon on his arm, and was received in an audience by the Emperor Meiji; George and his brother presented Empress Haruko with two wallabies from Australia.

35,where does kurdish people live?,"Iraq, Turkey, Iran, and Syria.",Asia,"Kurdish Diaspora With a population estimated around 30 million, the Kurds are one of the largest groups of people without a proper nation state. Their traditional homeland, Kurdistan, was forcibly broken up through centuries of political turmoil in the Middle East. The land that was once Kurdistan is currently divided along the borders of Iran, Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. The Kurds who inhabit this land have suffered from persecution for centuries. As early as the 16th century, Kurds were subject to a program of relocation and deportation as punishment for rebellion against the Safavid dynasty. In more recent history, the Pahlavi dynasty persecuted Kurds from WWI until its fall in 1979, and Saddam Hussein's infamous al-Anfal campaign resulted in tens of thousands of Kurdish deaths in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Although the majority of Kurds still live in Kurdistan, many Kurds have left the region as a result of this continued persecution. While there is no recent, accurate census of the Kurdish diaspora, widely accepted figures estimate around 1.2 million Kurds living outside Kurdistan, with around half of those Kurds living in Germany. Population numbers can be seen in the table below. The majority of Kurds living in the west are from Turkey (approximately 80%), and Kurds from Iraq make up the second largest group of Kurds in the west. Source: Council on Foreign Relations The Kurds living outside of Kurdistan have been widely recognized for their use of literature, film, and art in the promotion of Kurdish culture and political awareness. Kurdish awareness in the west has been promoted by numerous organizations including the Kurdish Institute of Paris, the Kurdish Institute of Brussels, and the Kurdish American Society

Kurd, any member of an ethnic and linguistic group concentrated in the Taurus Mountains of southeastern Anatolia, the Zagros Mountains of western Iran, portions of northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and western Armenia, and other, adjacent areas. Most Kurds live in contiguous areas of Iran, Iraq, and Turkey--a somewhat loosely defined geographic region generally referred to as Kurdistan (""Land of the Kurds""). The name has different connotations in Iran and Iraq than elsewhere, because the two countries officially recognize internal entities by this name: Iran's western province Kordestan and Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region. A sizable noncontiguous Kurdish population exists in the Khorasan region, situated in Iran's northeast. The Kurdish language, with nearly 25 million speakers, is a West Iranian language that is closely related to Persian and Pashto. The Kurds were thought to number between 36 million and 46 million in the mid-2010s. They lived primarily in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria with diasporic communities in Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union. However, sources for this information differ widely because of differing criteria of ethnicity, religion, and language; statistics may also be manipulated for political purposes. The traditional Kurdish way of life was nomadic, revolving around sheep and goat herding throughout the Mesopotamian plains and the highlands of Turkey and Iran. Most Kurds practiced only marginal agriculture. The enforcement of national boundaries beginning after World War I (1914-18) impeded the seasonal migrations of the flocks, forcing most of the Kurds to abandon their traditional ways for village life and settled farming; others entered nontraditional employment. History The prehistory of the Kurds is poorly known, but their ancestors seem to have inhabited the same upland region for centuries or, as some have argued, millennia. The records of the early empires of Mesopotamia contain references to mountain tribes with

Who are the Kurds? Between 25 and 35 million Kurds inhabit a mountainous region straddling the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. They make up the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation state. Where do they come from? The Kurds are one of the indigenous peoples of the Mesopotamian plains and the highlands in what are now south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Syria, northern Iraq, north-western Iran and south-western Armenia. Today, they form a distinctive community, united through race, culture and language, even though they have no standard dialect. They also adhere to a number of different religions and creeds, although the majority are Sunni Muslims. Why don't they have a state? Despite their long history, the Kurds have never achieved a permanent nation state In the early 20th Century, many Kurds began to consider the creation of a homeland - generally referred to as ""Kurdistan"". After World War One and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Western allies made provision for a Kurdish state in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres. Such hopes were dashed three years later, however, when the Treaty of Lausanne, which set the boundaries of modern Turkey, made no provision for a Kurdish state and left Kurds with minority status in their respective countries. Over the next 80 years, any move by Kurds to set up an independent state was brutally quashed. Why were Kurds at the forefront of the fight against IS? Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been fighting IS militants in northern Iraq In mid-2013, the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) turned its sights on three Kurdish enclaves that bordered territory under its control in northern Syria. It launched repeated attacks that until mid-2014 were repelled by the People's Protection Units (YPG) - the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). An IS advance in northern Iraq in June 2014 also drew that country's Kurds into the

Kurdish culture is a group of distinctive cultural traits practiced by Kurdish people. The Kurdish culture is a legacy from ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society. Kurds are an ethnic group who live in the northern Middle East, in a region that the Kurds call Greater Kurdistan. Greater Kurdistan lies along the Zagros Mountains and the Taurus Mountains, and today comprises northeastern Iraq, northwestern Iran, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey. == Miscellaneous == There is a lot of controversy about the Kurdish people from their origins, their history, and even their political future. Kurds are one of the largest ethnic groups that do not have an independent state recognized universally. == Language == Kurdish (Kurdî) is part of the North-Western division of the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. == Folklore == The Kurds have a rich folkloric tradition which is increasingly endangered as a result of modernization, urbanization, and cultural repression. Kurds celebrate the new year on Newroz, and its celebration was often banned by authorities in Turkey and Syria. A well known Kurdish tale is Mem û Zîn. === Zembilfrosh === Zembilfrosh (Kurdish: زەمبیلفرۆش) (Kurdish for ""basket seller"") is a folktale popular in Turkish Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan. Zembilfrosh was the son of a powerful Kurdish ruler who left his home and life behind to seek a spiritual life as a dervish. He wanders the countryside with his faithful wife, surviving by making and selling baskets. One day they arrive in the capital of a Kurdish emirate, where the prince's wife sees Zembilfrosh and falls in love with him. She summons him to the castle, where she declares her love for him and tries to seduce him. Zembilfrosh declines, but she presses, promising him many riches. Zembilfrosh is not persuaded and she locks him in a castle tower, from which he eventually escapes. The prince's wife then disguises herself and starts searching for Zembilfrosh, and

The Kurds are an Iranian ethnic group in the Middle East. They have historically inhabited the mountainous areas to the south of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, a geographical area collectively referred to as Kurdistan. Most Kurds speak Northern Kurdish Kurmanji Kurdish (Kurmanji) and Central Kurdish (Sorani). There are various hypotheses as to predecessor populations of the Kurds, such as the Carduchoi of Classical Antiquity. The earliest known Kurdish dynasties under Islamic rule (10th to 12th centuries) are the Hasanwayhids, the Marwanids, the Rawadids, the Shaddadids, followed by the Ayyubid dynasty founded by Saladin. The Battle of Chaldiran of 1514 is an important turning point in Kurdish history, marking the alliance of Kurds with the Ottomans. The Sharafnameh of 1597 is the first account of Kurdish history. Kurdish history in the 20th century is marked by a rising sense of Kurdish nationhood focused on the goal of an independent Kurdistan as scheduled by the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920. Partial autonomy was reached by Kurdistan Uyezd (1923–1926) and by Iraqi Kurdistan (since 1991), while notably in Turkish Kurdistan, an armed conflict between the Kurdish insurgent groups and Turkish Armed Forces was ongoing from 1984 to 1999, and the region continues to be unstable with renewed violence flaring up in the 2000s. == Name == There are different theories about the origin of the name Kurd. According to one theory, it originates in Middle Persian as كورت kwrt-, a term for ""nomad; tent-dweller"". After the Muslim conquest of Persia, this term was adopted into Arabic as kurd-, and was used specifically for nomadic tribes. The ethnonym Kurd may ultimately derive from an ancient toponym in the upper Tigris basin. According to the English Orientalist Godfrey Rolles Driver, the term Kurd is related to the Sumerian Karda which was found in Sumerian clay tablets of the third millennium B.C. He wrote in a paper published in 1923 that the term Kurd was not used differently by",2,1,5,5
36,what are members of the house of representatives called?,Representatives,Representative,"The United States House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the United States Congress, with the Senate being the upper chamber. Together, they compose the national bicameral legislature of the United States. The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation, known as bills; those that are also passed by the Senate are sent to the president for signature or veto. The House's exclusive powers include initiating all revenue bills, impeaching federal officers, and electing the president if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Members of the House serve a fixed term of two years, with each seat up for election before the start of the next Congress. Special elections also occur when a seat is vacated early enough. The House's composition was established by Article One of the United States Constitution. The House is composed of representatives who, pursuant to the Uniform Congressional District Act, sit in single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population as measured by the United States census, with each district having at least a single representative, provided that that state is entitled to them. Since its inception in 1789, all representatives have been directly elected. Although suffrage was initially limited, it gradually widened, particularly after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment and the civil rights movement. Since 1913, the number of voting representatives has been at 435 pursuant to the Apportionment Act of 1911. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 capped the size of the House at 435. However, the number was temporarily increased from 1959 until 1963 to 437 following the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii to the Union. In addition, five non-voting delegates represent the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.

You should call House members 'representatives,' because that's what they are - not 'congressmen' or 'congresswomen' Author Disclosure statement Daniel Wirls does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. Partners For most of the nation's history, members of the U.S. House of Representatives have been addressed as ""Congressman"" or ""Congresswoman."" By contrast, a senator is referred to as, well, ""Senator."" These gendered terms for House members dominate in journalism, everyday conversation and among members of Congress. The name Congress refers to the entire national legislature, composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Gender identity aside, Congressman and Congresswoman are fundamentally inaccurate terms. In the Constitution, Congress refers to the legislative branch as a whole. When discussing the membership of Congress, the Constitution uses ""Representatives"" and ""Senators,"" but also ""Members"" in reference to both. ""Congressman"" is nowhere in that founding document. One of the foremost scholars of Congress, the late Richard Fenno, wrote, ""a House member's designation, as prescribed in the U.S. Constitution, is not Congressman, it is Representative."" As a scholar of Congress and particularly the Senate, I am interested in the differences between the two chambers and how that affects American politics. In my investigation of the origins and evolution of congressman and congresswoman, I combed the records of colonial and state legislatures, as well as records related to the country's founding and newspapers from the end of the 1700s to the mid-1900s. Even if the current era were not one of justified sensitivity to gender neutrality and diversity, these two terms for House members are not just dated, they are wrong. Representative is the correct but rarely used term. The people whose names

A Note About Room Numbering The three primary House office buildings--Cannon, Longworth and Rayburn--share a room numbering system for above-ground rooms that might confuse visitors at first. The system is fairly straight forward and can be used to identify most member and committee offices merely by knowing the correct room number regardless of building. All Cannon above-ground rooms are three digits. As you would expect, the first digit indicates the floor level. For example, 303 Cannon is on the 3rd floor. All above-ground Longworth rooms are four digits and start with the number 1. The second digit from the left indicates the floor. For example, 1309 is on the third floor of the Longworth building. All above-ground Rayburn rooms are also four digits, but start with a 2. The second digit indicates the floor number. For example, 2125 is on the first floor of Rayburn.

debate, the framers of the Constitution agreed to create the House with representation based on population and the Senate with equal representation. This agreement was part of what is referred to as The Great Compromise. House leadership includes the speaker, majority and minority leaders, assistant leaders, whips and a party caucus or conference. The speaker acts as leader of the House and combines several institutional and administrative roles. Majority and minority leaders represent their respective parties on the House floor. Whips assist leadership in managing their party's legislative program on the House floor. A party caucus or conference is the name given to a meeting of or organization of all party members in the House. During these meetings, party members discuss matters of concern. The majority party members and the minority party members meet in separate caucuses to select their leader. Third parties rarely have had enough members to elect their own leadership, and independents will generally join one of the larger party organizations to receive committee assignments. The House's standing committees have different legislative jurisdictions. Each considers bills and issues and recommends measures for consideration by the House. Committees also have oversight responsibilities to monitor agencies, programs, and activities within their jurisdictions, and in some cases in areas that cut across committee jurisdictions. The Committee of the Whole House is a committee of the House on which all representatives serve and which meets in the House Chamber for the consideration of measures from the Union calendar. Before members are assigned to committees, each committee's size and the proportion of Republicans to Democrats must be decided by the party leaders. The total number of committee slots allotted to each party is approximately the same as the ratio between majority party and minority party members in the full chamber. Did You Know?

The Press Herald mainly serves southern Maine and is focused on the greater metropolitan area of Portland. Founded in 1862, its roots extend to Maine’s earliest newspapers, the Falmouth Gazette & Weekly Advertiser, started in 1785, and the Eastern Argus, first published in Portland in 1803. For most of the 20th century, it was the cornerstone of Guy Gannett Communications, before being sold to The Seattle Times Company in 1998. Since 2023, it has been a part of the Maine Trust for Local News, a nonprofit group run by the National Trust for Local News that includes four other daily newspapers and 17 weekly newspapers. == History == === 19th century origins === The Portland Daily Press was founded in June 1862 by J. T. Gilman, Joseph B. Hall, and Newell A. Foster as a new Republican paper. Its first issue, published on June 23, 1862, announced strong support for Abraham Lincoln and condemned slavery as ""the foulest blot upon our national character."" Its offices, along with the offices of all the newspapers in the city, were destroyed on July 4, 1866, in Portland's Great Fire. On the morning of July 6, the Portland Daily Press published a double-sided handbill about the fire. The paper quickly gained the largest circulation in Portland, and was one of five daily newspapers in the city to survive to the 20th century. In 1904, the paper was bought by a syndicate of Maine Republicans, including Henry B. Cleaves and gubernatorial candidate Joseph Homan Manley, who the paper had previously opposed. === Guy Gannett ownership === In 1921, the Portland Daily Press was merged with the Portland Herald to form the Portland Press Herald in a sale of the Press from then U.S. Senator Frederick Hale to Guy P.

More important, she reminded investigators that two police officers had been writing parking tickets on her street that night. A search of tickets issued eventually turned up Berkowitz's car. At the same time, Yonkers police investigated Berkowitz after he escalated a harassment campaign against one of his neighbors. Convinced he was the Son of Sam, they informed the Omega task force of their findings. The Omega detectives finally put two and two together, and on August 10 David Berkowitz was arrested while leaving his Yonkers home. He gleefully admitted to being the Son of Sam. On his person was a semiautomatic rifle, and he explained he was on his way to commit another murder. The .44-caliber revolver was also recovered. There was some question about whether Berkowitz was mentally fit to stand trial, but on May 8, 1978, he withdrew an insanity defense and pleaded guilty to the six murders. Berkowitz, in fact, appeared to enjoy the media attention his case was receiving and he proceeded to sell his exclusive story rights to a publishing house. That prompted New York state to adopt the first in a nationwide series of so-called ""Son of Sam laws"" that take proceeds a criminal earns from selling their story and gives them to a victims' compensation fund. Berkowitz was given six 25-years-to-life sentences for the crime, the maximum penalty allowed at the time. He has since been denied parole.

39,what countries does the panama canal go through?,Panama,Panama Canal Zone,"The Panama Canal (Spanish: Canal de Panamá) is an artificial 82-kilometer (51-mile) waterway in Panama that connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean. It cuts across the narrowest point of the Isthmus of Panama, and is a conduit for maritime trade between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial fresh water lake 26 meters (85 ft) above sea level, created by damming up the Chagres River and Lake Alajuela to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal. Locks then lower the ships at the other end. An average of 200 ML (52,000,000 US gal) of fresh water is used in a single passing of a ship. The canal is threatened by low water levels during droughts. The Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage, the Strait of Magellan or the Beagle Channel. It is one of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken. Since its inauguration on August 15, 1914, the canal has succeeded in shortening maritime communication in time and distance, invigorating maritime and economic transportation by providing a short and relatively inexpensive transit route between the two oceans, decisively influencing global trade patterns, boosting economic growth in developed and developing countries, as well as providing the basic impetus for economic expansion in many remote regions of the world. Colombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped in 1889 because of lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The US took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal in 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the

west coasts of the United States, which otherwise would be obliged to round Cape Horn in South America, shorten their voyage by about 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km) by using the canal. Savings of up to 3,500 nautical miles (6,500 km) are also made on voyages between one coast of North America and ports on the other side of South America. Ships sailing between Europe and East Asia or Australia can save as much as 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) by using the canal. From its opening in 1914 until 1979, the Panama Canal was controlled solely by the United States, which built it. In 1979, however, control of the canal passed to the Panama Canal Commission, a joint agency of the United States and the Republic of Panama, and complete control passed to Panama at noon on December 31, 1999. Administration of the canal is the responsibility of the Panama Canal Authority (Spanish: Autoridad del Canal de Panama [ACP]), which answers solely to the government of Panama. Physical features The canal The Panama Canal lies at a latitude of 9deg N, at a point where the North American Continental Divide dips to one of its lowest points. The canal does not, as is generally supposed, cross the isthmus from east to west. It runs due south from its entrance at Colon on the Atlantic side through the Gatun Locks to a point in the widest portion of Gatun Lake; it then turns sharply toward the east and follows a course generally to the southeast until it reaches the Bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Its terminus near Balboa is some 25 miles (40 km) east of its terminus near Colon. Parallel to the canal are the Panama Canal Railway and the Boyd-Roosevelt Highway. In passing from the Atlantic to the Pacific, vessels enter the approach channel in Limon Bay, which extends a distance of about 7 miles (11 km) to the Gatun Locks. At Gatun a series of three locks lifts vessels 85 feet (26 metres) to Gatun Lake. The lake, formed by Gatun Dam on the Chagres River and supplemented by waters from

Panama, officially the Republic of Panama, is a country in Latin America at the southern end of Central America, bordering South America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Its capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's over 4 million inhabitants. Before the arrival of Spanish colonists in the 16th century, Panama was inhabited by a number of different indigenous tribes. It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. The 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties agreed to transfer the canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999. The surrounding territory was returned first, in 1979. Revenue from canal tolls has continued to represent a significant portion of Panama's GDP, especially after the Panama Canal expansion project (finished in 2016) doubled its capacity. Commerce, banking, and tourism are major sectors. Panama is regarded as having a high-income economy. In 2019, Panama ranked 57th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index. In 2018, Panama was ranked the seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. Panama was ranked 82rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024. Covering around 40 percent of its land area, Panama's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals – some of them found nowhere else on earth. Panama is a founding member of the United Nations and other international organizations such as the

Connecting the world through the Panama Canal The Panama Canal has improved global commerce, transportation, and connectivity for more than 100 years. Through its shortened route and strategic location, the Panama Canal continues to expand its partnerships across the world and innovate its services to uphold its commitment to creating, capturing and rendering value to its customers and Panama. Connecting 170 Countries Since the opening of the Neopanamax Locks in 2016, the Panama Canal has come to serve 36 new maritime routes, connecting an additional 220 ports and 10 countries. Today, the waterway serves a total of 180 maritime routes that link 1,920 ports across 170 countries. Through this expanded number of routes, new terminals have become points of origin or destination for cargo that transits the Canal, such as the liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals of Cove Point and Cameron in the United States and Port of Point Fortin in Trinidad and Tobago. The United States remains the top user country of the Panama Canal, with two-thirds of cargo transported through the waterway originating from or destined for this market, followed by China and Japan. The main route using the waterway by cargo tonnage runs between the U.S. East Coast and Asia. It is followed by the U.S. East Coast and the West Coast of South America, Europe and the West Coast South America, the U.S. East Coast and the West Coast of Central America, and the South America intercoastal route. Facilitating Grain Exports Traditionally, the dry bulk market has been and continues to be important in terms of the cargo tonnage transported through the Panama Canal. The main commodities moved in bulk cargo vessels consist of soybeans, corn and miscellaneous grains. The grain flows originate in U.S. ports located on the Gulf of Mexico region destined for China, the West Coast of South America, Japan and the West Coast of Central America. Soybeans are the most prominent commodity crop that navigates the

What is the Panama Canal? The Panama Canal is a constructed waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans across the Isthmus of Panama. It is owned and administered by Panama, and it is 40 miles long from shoreline to shoreline. Ships can cross going in either direction, and it takes about 10 hours to get from one side to the other. Ships from any country are treated equally with respect to conditions of passage and tolls. Why is the Panama Canal important? Before the Panama Canal was built, ships traveling between the east and west coasts of the American continents had to go around Cape Horn in South America, a voyage that was some 8,000 nautical miles longer then going through the canal and that took about two months to complete. All journeys between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are shortened by thousands of nautical miles by going through the canal. Why does the Panama Canal need locks? A mountain range runs the length of Panama, including through the Canal Zone, though it is lower there. In addition, the tidal levels of the oceans on either side of the Panama Canal differ. Locks raise ships to the level of the lakes (which account for about half the distance of the canal) and then lower them to sea level. Panama Canal, lock-type canal, owned and administered by the Republic of Panama, that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow Isthmus of Panama. The length of the Panama Canal from shoreline to shoreline is about 40 miles (65 km) and from deep water in the Atlantic (more specifically, the Caribbean Sea) to deep water in the Pacific about 50 miles (82 km). The canal, which was completed in August 1914, is one of the two most strategic artificial waterways in the world, the other being the Suez Canal. Ships sailing between the east and west coasts of the United States, which otherwise would be obliged to round Cape Horn in South America, shorten their voyage by about 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km) by using the canal.

During the previous season, Sam went to Italy to stop Frasier and Diane's wedding. This season, he fails to do so, and returns to Boston. Several months later, Frasier comes to the bar to announce that Diane jilted him at the altar, made love to other men, and is now in a convent, located one hour away from Boston. Sam retrieves Diane from the convent and rehires her as a bar waitress. After having lost everything, including his career, Frasier frequently visits the Boston bar, Cheers, for drinks and then slowly degenerates into alcoholism. He recovers, then begins another psychiatric job, distancing himself from Sam and Diane's relationship. Sam then begins a relationship with the city councillor Janet Eldrige (Kate Mulgrew).

41,who plays bob kelso in scrubs?,"Christopher Meloni played Bob Kelso in Scrubs. However, it's important to note that Bob Kelso was actually portrayed by Patrick Warburton throughout the series.",Ken Jenkins,"Robert ""Bob"" Kelso, M.D., is a fictional character played by Ken Jenkins in the American comedy-drama Scrubs. Bob Kelso is the chief of medicine for Sacred Heart Hospital for the first seven seasons of Scrubs (a position held since 1984), though he resigns in the episode ""My Dumb Luck"". Kelso appeared in every episode during the first eight seasons except three Season 8 episodes, ""My Last Words"", ""Their Story II"" and ""My Full Moon"". Jenkins was a regular cast member for the first eight seasons, and appeared in nine episodes of season nine. == Profile == Of all the Scrubs characters, he goes through the most pronounced change as the series progresses. In the first few seasons, he appears to be a cynical, heartless man who gives mere lip service to patients' well-being, putting more value on the hospital's bottom line and his own personal comfort. In a moment of brutal candor in the series premiere, Kelso tells series protagonist John ""J.D."" Dorian, ""Do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me?"" Throughout the series, though, events suggest that Kelso's cynicism is a defense mechanism to deal with the pressures of his position. In later seasons he gradually becomes more compassionate, and after retirement, he remains in the other characters' lives as a grandfatherly figure. Throughout the series, he is at odds with Dr. Perry Cox (John C. McGinley), Sacred Heart's Chief Attending Physician who eventually replaces him as Chief of Medicine. Cox calls him ""Bobbo"" or some other variation, often refers to him as a ""pod person"" or ""the Devil himself"", and once even punches him out. The two have occasionally shared moments of understanding and compassion, however, such as when Kelso tells a depressed Cox that the hospital and Kelso himself needs him, as they balance each other out to do what is best for the hospital. After his retirement, Kelso becomes more openly friendly with Cox. His wife, Enid, and children are never seen on the show, although

they balance each other out to do what is best for the hospital. After his retirement, Kelso becomes more openly friendly with Cox. His wife, Enid, and children are never seen on the show, although he frequently comments on his spouse, describing her as morbidly obese, neurotic, and using a wheelchair after an accident that left her paralyzed. Enid was a nurse working at the hospital during his early days as an M.D. and he has one child by her, a son called Harrison, a gay, drug-dealing heavy metal fan who wrote a scathing musical about him titled Dr. Dad and ""shacked up"" with the actor playing Kelso. Kelso also has a secret love child, Trong Tri Kelso, by a Vietnamese woman he had an affair with during his tour in Vietnam. Although he considers his children to be embarrassing, it is shown he genuinely loves Harrison and pays for Trong Tri's college education. He frequently cheats on his wife, and is open about his love of prostitutes. Kelso also suffers from a sexually transmitted disease which he has kept hidden from Enid. Kelso was born in 1942 in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, where his family, then named Kelsonovich, settled. His father, also a doctor, endeared himself to his poorer patients by accepting gifts such as food and clothing in lieu of actual payment. The elder Kelso was apparently less generous to his own family, however, and he left the family on Kelso's own bicycle (an event to which Kelso attributes his irrational hatred of bikes). Before becoming a doctor, Kelso had a promising career as a shortstop; however, his treatment of other players earned him a permanent ban from the Appalachian League. Kelso attended medical school at Stanford University, graduating in 1968. Kelso was in the United States Navy SEALs during the Vietnam War. He has a tattoo of the word ""Johnny"" on his buttocks (""...he's an old sailor buddy, and if you went through what we did, you'd understand""). In the seventh season, he turns 65, which is the hospital's mandatory

Scrubs (stylized as [scrubs]) is an American medical sitcom created by Bill Lawrence that aired from October 2, 2001, to March 17, 2010, on NBC and later ABC. The series follows the lives of employees at the fictional Sacred Heart Hospital, which is a teaching hospital. The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters are medical interns. The series was noted for its fast-paced slapstick and surreal vignettes presented mostly as the daydreams of the central character, John ""J.D."" Dorian, played by Zach Braff. The main cast for all but its last season consisted of Braff, Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C. McGinley, and Judy Reyes. The series featured multiple guest appearances by film actors, such as Brendan Fraser, Heather Graham, Michael J. Fox and Colin Farrell. Although season eight's ""My Finale"" was conceived and filmed as a series finale, the show was eventually revived for a ninth season subtitled Med School, with the setting moved to a medical school and new cast members introduced. Of the original cast only Braff, Faison, and McGinley remained regular cast members, while others (except Reyes) made guest appearances; Kerry Bishé, Eliza Coupe, Dave Franco, and Michael Mosley became series regulars, with Bishé becoming the show's new narrator. Scrubs, produced by ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television), premiered on October 2, 2001, on NBC. The series received a Peabody Award in 2006. During the seventh season, NBC announced that it would not renew the show; ABC announced it had picked up the eighth season of the series, intended to be the final season, which began airing on January 6, 2009. A ninth season, subtitled Med School, premiered on December 1, 2009, and on May 14, 2010, ABC officially canceled the series. == Overview == Scrubs focuses on the unique point of view of its main character and narrator, Dr. John Michael ""J.D.""

December 1, 2009, and on May 14, 2010, ABC officially canceled the series. == Overview == Scrubs focuses on the unique point of view of its main character and narrator, Dr. John Michael ""J.D."" Dorian (Zach Braff) for the first eight seasons, with season nine being narrated by the new main character Lucy Bennett (Kerry Bishé). Most episodes feature multiple story lines thematically linked by voice-overs done by Braff, as well as the comical daydreams of J.D. According to Bill Lawrence, ""What we decided was, rather than have it be a monotone narration, if it's going to be Zach's voice, we're going to do everything through J.D.'s eyes. It opened up a visual medium that those of us as comedy writers were not used to."" Actors were given the chance to improvise their lines on set with encouragement by series creator Bill Lawrence, with Neil Flynn and Zach Braff being the main improvisors. Almost every episode title for the first eight seasons begins with the word ""My"". Bill Lawrence says this is because each episode is Dr. John Dorian writing in his diary (revealed in the commentary on the DVD of the first-season episode ""My Hero""). A few episodes are told from another character's perspective and have episode titles such as ""His Story"" or ""Her Story"". Apart from a brief period of narration from J.D. at the beginning and the end, these episodes primarily contain internal narration from other characters besides J.D. The transfer of the narration duties usually occurs at a moment of physical contact between two characters. Starting with season nine, the episode titles start with ""Our..."" as the focus has shifted from the perspective of J.D. to a new group of medical students. The webisodes that accompanied season eight, Scrubs: Interns, also were named ""Our..."". == Cast and characters == For the first eight seasons, the series featured seven main cast members, with numerous other characters recurring throughout the course of the series.

South Los Angeles, also known as South Central Los Angeles or simply South Central, is a region in southwestern Los Angeles County, California, lying mostly within the city limits of Los Angeles, south of downtown. It is ""defined on Los Angeles city maps as a 16-square-mile (41 km2) rectangle with two prongs at the south end.” In 2003, the Los Angeles City Council renamed this area ""South Los Angeles"". The name South Los Angeles can also refer to a larger 51-square-mile (130 km2) region that includes areas within the city limits of Los Angeles as well as five unincorporated areas in the southern portion of Los Angeles County. == Geography == === City of Los Angeles === The City of Los Angeles delineates the South Los Angeles Community Plan area as an area of 15.5 square miles (40 km2). Adjacent communities include West Adams, Baldwin Hills, and Leimert Park to the west, and Southeast Los Angeles (the 26-neighborhood area east of the Harbor Freeway) on the east. === Los Angeles Times Mapping Project === According to the Los Angeles Times Mapping Project, the South Los Angeles region comprises 51 square miles (130 km2), consisting of 25 neighborhoods within the city of Los Angeles as well as three unincorporated neighborhoods in the county of Los Angeles. === Google Maps === Google Maps delineates a similar area to the Los Angeles Times Mapping Project with notable differences on the western border. On the northwest, it omits a section of Los Angeles west of La Brea Avenue. On the southwest, it includes a section of the city of Inglewood north of Century Boulevard. === Districts and neighborhoods === According to the Mapping L.A. survey of the Los Angeles Times, the South Los Angeles region consists of the following neighborhoods: ==== City of Los Angeles ==== ==== Unincorporated county neighborhoods ==== == History == The roots of South Los Angeles traces back to the beginning of the 20th Century. === Pre-1948 === Until the 1920s, the South Los Angeles neighborhood

East Los Angeles (Spanish: Este de Los Ángeles), or East L.A., is an unincorporated area situated within Los Angeles County, California, United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, East Los Angeles is designated as a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes. The most recent data from the 2020 census reports a population of 118,786, reflecting a 6.1% decrease compared to the 2010 population of 126,496. The concentration of Hispanic/Latino Americans is 95.16 percent, the highest of any city or census-designated place in the United States outside of Puerto Rico. == History == === Original East Los Angeles === Historically, when it was founded in 1873, the neighborhood northeast of downtown known today as Lincoln Heights was originally named East Los Angeles, but in 1917, residents voted to change the name to its present name. Today, it is considered part of Eastside Los Angeles, the geographic region east of the Los Angeles River that includes three neighborhoods within the city of Los Angeles (Boyle Heights, El Sereno, and Lincoln Heights) and the unincorporated community in Los Angeles County known today as ""East Los Angeles"". Lincoln Heights is 4 miles (6 km) northwest of present-day East Los Angeles. When Lincoln Heights, the first Eastside subdivision created in 1873, changed its name in 1917, Belvedere (Belvedere Gardens and Belvedere Heights) and surrounding unincorporated county areas were given the moniker of East Los Angeles. By the 1930s, most maps had started to label the Belvedere area as ""East Los Angeles"". === Belvedere === The cornerstone of the first building of Occidental College was laid in September 1887 on Rowan Street. In 1896, the building was destroyed by fire. On April 2, 1905, it was reported that the Janss Investment Company would be developing an area ""on Boyle Heights"" (later, Boyle Heights would refer only to a smaller area to the west, i.e. the neighborhood now called Boyle Heights within the Los Angeles

county neighborhoods ==== == History == The roots of South Los Angeles traces back to the beginning of the 20th Century. === Pre-1948 === Until the 1920s, the South Los Angeles neighborhood of West Adams was one of the most desirable areas of the City. As the wealthy were building stately mansions in West Adams and Jefferson Park, the White working class was establishing itself in Crenshaw and Hyde Park. Affluent blacks gradually moved into West Adams and Jefferson Park. As construction along the Wilshire Boulevard corridor gradually increased in the 1920s, the development of the city was drawn west of downtown and away from South Los Angeles. In the eastern side of South Los Angeles (which the city calls the ""Southeastern CPA"") roughly east of the Harbor Freeway, the area grew southward in the late 1800s along the ever-longer streetcar routes. Areas north of Slauson Boulevard were mostly built out by the late 1910s, while south of Slauson land was mostly undeveloped, much used by Chinese and Japanese Americans growing produce. In 1903, the farmers were bought out and Ascot Park racetrack was built, which turned into a ""den of gambling and drinking"". In the late 1910s the park was razed and freed up land for quick build-up of residential and industrial buildings in the 1920s. ""By 1940, approximately 70 percent of the black population of Los Angeles was confined to the Central Avenue corridor""; the area of modest bungalows and low-rise commercial buildings along Central Avenue emerged as the heart of the black community in southern California. Originally, the city's black community was concentrated around what is now Little Tokyo, but began moving south after 1900. It had one of the first jazz scenes in the western U.S., with trombonist Kid Ory a prominent resident. Under racially restrictive covenants, blacks were allowed to own property only within the ""Slauson Box"" (the area bounded by Main, Slauson, Alameda, and Washington) and in Watts, as well as in small",5,1,5,1

Nike's North American revenue from footwear amounted to roughly 14.5 billion U.S. dollars in the year ended May 31, 2024, which was far greater than that of the apparel and equipment segments combined. That said, only the equipment segment recorded noticeable sales growth in the last year. A broad portfolio Nike offers an extremely broad array of products within the apparel and sports equipment market. As one of the leading companies, Nike tries to stay ahead of the game and create new, unique and innovative products to give their athletes, and their profit margins the edge. This can be seen in the number of patents filed by Nike. These patents cover a wide array of technology areas, primarily design, followed by footwear. Nike shoes And Nike's investment in footwear is rewarded, as the revenue of Nike's footwear segment compared to Adidas and Puma is far greater than that of its competitors. Nike has many lines of iconic shoes, from their air Jordan line to the extremely limited-edition Nike Air mags. These were shoes based on the film Back to the Future, which feature self-lacing technology.

Sneaker collecting is the acquisition and trading of sneakers as a hobby. It is often manifested by the use and collection of shoes made for particular sports, particularly basketball and skateboarding. A person involved in sneaker collecting is sometimes called a sneakerhead. Sneaker collecting came to prominence in the 1980s in New York City and can be attributed to two major sources: basketball, specifically the emergence of Michael Jordan and his eponymous Air Jordan line of shoes released in 1985, and the growth of hip hop music. The boom of signature basketball shoes during this era provided the sheer variety necessary for a collecting subculture, while the hip-hop movement gave the sneakers their street credibility as status symbols. Sneakerhead culture has extended beyond shoes designed for particular sports, and overlaps with streetwear trends and styles. By one estimate, the sneaker resale market was worth US$10 billion in 2021. == History == Consumers started to collect, trade and resell sneakers in the 1970s, and the sneakerhead subculture came to prominence in New York City during the 1980s. Sneakers such as the Adidas Superstar and Puma Suede were popularized by b-boys and hip-hop artists, and Nike's Air Jordan line revolutionized the industry with its marketing linked to superstar basketball player Michael Jordan. During the 1960s and 1970s, street basketball was widely played in the streets of the Bronx. One of the important rituals among the players was ""stepsies"", which was a game for everyone to step on a player's new sneakers. A clean pair of sneakers indicated that the player was weak. However, with the rise of hip hop music, a ""clean and fresh"" look gained popularity and the game of ""stepsies"" lost favor. Since the 1970s, there has been a strict rule against combining rival brands. For example, a person wearing Nike sneakers with Adidas track pants would be considered as someone going against the culture. This type of violation lowers a

rule against combining rival brands. For example, a person wearing Nike sneakers with Adidas track pants would be considered as someone going against the culture. This type of violation lowers a person's reputation and shows their lack of awareness of the culture, similar to forgetting to remove the tag from a designer suit. This practice led sneakerheads to favor one brand over another, resulting in strong brand loyalty. Although the concept of brand exclusively has diminished, the art of mixing brands properly has evolved as streetwear, luxury fashion, and sportswear became significant aspects of sneaker culture. Sneaker culture became global by the end of the 1990s. Originally popular among urban black youth and white skateboarders, by the 21st century it had gained a sizable Asian following. Sneakers have had cult followings in Japan since the 1990s, where many American fashion brands remain highly covetable. Outside the US, Japan is one of the only markets where limited-edition styles (particularly Nikes) have had region-exclusive releases. == Culture == Sneaker collectors buy online and go to outlets, sneaker events, swapmeets, parties, and gatherings in search of rare, vintage, and limited edition shoes. New launches of popular sneaker models increasingly take place via online raffles through mobile apps. Collectible sneakers can usually be resold for well above their original retail price, including certain collaborations with various athletes and celebrities. Popular fashion trends in sneaker culture usually overlap with streetwear trends and styles. Sneakerheads often participate in both online and offline activities to show their enthusiasm in sneakers. Typical example of offline activity is participating in sneaker exhibitions. Some of the notable exhibitions include Sneakercon in North America and Southeast Asia, Sneakerness in Europe, and Faces&Laces in Russia. Through these exhibitions, sneakerheads show their collections, sell or exchange sneakers,

45,what guitar did joe walsh play?,Gibson,Fender Stratocaster,"Joseph Fidler Walsh (born Joseph Woodward Fidler; November 20, 1947) is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Best known as a member of the rock band Eagles, his five-decade career includes solo work and stints in other bands: James Gang, Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band, and New Zealand's Herbs. He was part of the supergroup The Best and had success as a solo artist and prolific session musician, appearing on other artists' recordings. In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked him No. 54 on its list of ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"". In the mid-1960s, after attending Kent State University, Walsh played with several local Ohio bands before reaching national fame with the James Gang, whose hit ""Funk #49"" showcased his skills. Roger Abramson signed the James Gang to BPI in Cleveland. After leaving the James Gang in 1972, Walsh formed Barnstorm with Joe Vitale and Kenny Passarelli. Though the band produced three albums, their work was marketed as Walsh solo projects. The last Barnstorm album, So What (1974), featured significant contributions from Eagles members. At producer Bill Szymczyk's suggestion, Walsh joined the Eagles in 1975 as guitarist and keyboardist, replacing founding member Bernie Leadon. His first album with them was Hotel California. In 1998, a Guitarist magazine reader's poll named the solos by Walsh and Don Felder on ""Hotel California"" the best guitar solos ever. Guitar World ranked it eighth in the Top 100 Guitar Solos. As a member of the Eagles, Walsh was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001. The Eagles are one of the most influential bands of the 1970s and remain one of the best-selling American bands in history. Walsh's contributions to music have been praised by rock legends like Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, and Pete Townshend. Walsh has released 12 solo studio albums, six compilation albums, and two live albums. His solo hits include ""Rocky Mountain Way"", ""Life's Been Good"", ""All Night

Eric Clapton, and Pete Townshend. Walsh has released 12 solo studio albums, six compilation albums, and two live albums. His solo hits include ""Rocky Mountain Way"", ""Life's Been Good"", ""All Night Long"", ""A Life of Illusion"", and ""Ordinary Average Guy"". == Early life and education == Walsh was born on November 20, 1947, in Wichita, Kansas. His father, Lt. Robert Newton Fidler, was a pilot for the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star in the United States Air Force and died in a plane crash in Okinawa on July 22, 1949. Walsh's mother, Helen, was a classically trained pianist of Scottish and German ancestry. Walsh was adopted by his stepfather at the age of five and given his stepfather's surname, but retained Fidler as his middle name. In the 1950s, it was common practice for children to take the name of their stepfather for Social Security, school registration, and health records. Walsh and his family lived in Columbus, Ohio, for a number of years during his youth. When he was twelve, his family moved to New York City. Later, Walsh moved to Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School, where he played oboe in the school band. Walsh acquired his first guitar at the age of 10, and upon learning the Ventures' ""Walk Don't Run"", decided that he wanted to pursue a career as a guitarist. Inspired by the success of the Beatles, he replaced Bruce Hoffman as the bass player in the locally popular group the Nomads in Madison, New Jersey, beginning his career as a rock musician. After high school, Walsh briefly attended Kent State University, where he spent time in various bands playing around the Cleveland, Ohio, area, including the Measles. The Measles recorded for Super K Productions' Ohio Express the songs ""I Find I Think of You"", ""And It's True"", and ""Maybe"" (an instrumental version of ""And It's True""). He planned to major in English and minor in music. Walsh has also stated he was present during the Kent State massacre in 1970. Walsh commented in 2012: ""Being at the

Walsh commented in 2012: ""Being at the shootings really affected me profoundly. I decided that maybe I don't need a degree that bad."" After one term, he dropped out of college to pursue his musical career. == Musical career == === 1

James Gang was an American rock band formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1966. The band went through a variety of line-up changes until they recorded their first album as a power trio consisting of Joe Walsh (guitars, lead vocals), Tom Kriss (bass) and Jim Fox (drums). Dale Peters replaced Kriss on bass for the band's second and third albums. Two of the band's songs, ""Funk #49"" and ""Walk Away"", continue to be popular on classic rock and AOR stations. In late 1971, Walsh left to pursue a solo career and would later join the Eagles. The band carried on with a number of other guitarists and lead singers to replace Walsh, but after failing to produce a hit song over the course of six more studio albums, the band finally broke up in 1977. Walsh, Fox and Peters have reformed for reunions since then, including September 3, 2022, when the power trio returned for a performance at the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert held in Wembley Stadium. == History == === Early years === Drummer Jim Fox first played with the Cleveland-area band the Outsiders but left them in 1965 to attend college. After they had a national hit the following year with ""Time Won't Let Me"", Fox returned temporarily to play with them after their drummer was drafted. After leaving them again to return to school, Fox, heavily influenced by the sound of British Invasion bands such as the Beatles, the Who and the Yardbirds, began to think about forming his own band and teamed up with schoolmate Ronnie Silverman (guitar), bassist Tom Kriss and keyboardist Phil Giallombardo in 1966. The James Gang's earliest lineup consisted of Fox (drums), Kriss (bass), Silverman (guitar), Giallombardo (vocals, keyboards), and after auditioning some 25 candidates for lead guitar, the band decided to go with Greg Grandillo, who later played with another popular Cleveland band, Rainbow Canyon. He was soon replaced by Dennis Chandler, who was then succeeded by John ""Mouse"" Michalski who, with the Count Five, had just enjoyed a national hit

another popular Cleveland band, Rainbow Canyon. He was soon replaced by Dennis Chandler, who was then succeeded by John ""Mouse"" Michalski who, with the Count Five, had just enjoyed a national hit with ""Psychotic Reaction"". A short time later, Fox was invited to audition for a nine-piece rhythm and blues band that was being assembled. Fox initially declined the offer but changed his mind when he heard that local guitar legend Glenn Schwartz, who was fresh out of the army, was to be in attendance. After hearing Schwartz play, and hearing that two of his influences were the Spencer Davis Group and Jeff Beck, Fox was impressed and invited Schwartz to join the James Gang. However, Michalski was not as enthused by Glenn's playing as Fox and left the band immediately. Ronnie Silverman soon departed as well to enter the military. Bill Jeric was then brought in to play alongside Schwartz. No recordings were ever released by these early lineups of the band. Around Christmastime of 1967, Schwartz, who was found to be AWOL from the army and was breaking up with his wife, decided to leave the band and move to California, where he ended up forming the band Pacific Gas & Electric. === Joe Walsh years === Just days later, shortly after the new year of 1968, a friend of Schwartz's, Joe Walsh (from a band called The Measles), knocked on Fox's door and asked to be given a tryout as Glenn's replacement. Walsh was accepted and the band continued as a five piece for a short time until Giallombardo, who was still in high school at the time, left. Jeric and Walsh worked together on guitar parts, but in the spring of 1968, Jeric ended up leaving as well. He was replaced by a returning Ronnie Silverman, who had been discharged from the military. On Sunday June 9, 1968 the group played a concert in Detroit at the Grande Ballroom opening for Cream. At the last minute, Silverman informed the others that he would not be joining them at the show. The band, desperately in need of the money, took",1,1,1,1

Outside of him presumably losing his fame, is unknown what happens to Chick afterwards, but it appears that he has been denied the sponsorship by Dinoco as Tex instead tries to offer it to Lightning for his good sportsmanship.

His commentary makes it clear that he is more than thrilled that Lightning is challenged by Jackson Storm, with whom he is shown to have a live interview after one of his victories. Lightning watches Chick's segment several times throughout the film to get up to date on Storm's latest progress. Personality[] Chick is extremely rude, arrogant and centered on himself and winning, not unlike Lightning himself. However, these traits are more exaggerated in Chick, and often make him more ridiculous or obnoxious. Chick always brags about winning, and he's also sarcastic and intimidating. Having lived all his career in the shadow of The King has made him bitter and devoid of any sense of fair play. Chick largely serves as a parallel to Lightning. They are both racers who dream of getting at Dinoco, which represents the peak of success. Lightning, however, learned to accept that helping others is more important than fame and fortune. Chick, on the other hand, failed to learn the error of his ways and let his anger be his downfall. Chick serves as an example of what Lightning would become if the latter had allowed his anger and arrogance to consume him. During his appearance in the third film, Chick still retains his selfish and

serves as an example of what Lightning would become if the latter had allowed his anger and arrogance to consume him. During his appearance in the third film, Chick still retains his selfish and bullying ways, mocking McQueen for being no match to Jackson Storm. Trivia[] Chick made his team wear ""mustache"" grilles to represent him. Chick has proven to be friends with DJ, Snot Rod, Boost and Wingo, who have helped him on various occasions. According to the 2009 Die-cast Collectors Guide, Chick Hicks has 334 decals on him. Chick is a 1979 Shyster Cremlin, a car that does not exist. It is designed after a 1987 Buick Grand National. Chick is one of the first few Pixar villains to actually win, though his win is more of a hollow victory due to his aggressive actions on the track. Despite having won his first Piston Cup, it is unknown if it really was his first and only win, as it has been mentioned that he had been in second place to The King in the point system and in racing. It is also never revealed if he won races before winning his first title prior to the film's events. 86, Chick's number, could reference 1986, the year that Pixar was established. Even though Chick didn't appear in Cars 2, players can download him for Cars 2: The Video Game. On his right door, there is a picture of the Marshy-Marshmellows logo. This is mostly the same company which was seen in A Bug's Life under the name of ""Joel's Marshy Marshmellows."" In the Polish version, his name is Marek Marucha. Ma rucha means ""He has speed."" A 1:55 scale die-cast of Chick Hicks appears in one of the exhibit elements at The Science Behind Pixar along with Lightning McQueen and Brush Curber.

Contents Official Description[] ""Chick Hicks is a racing veteran with a chip on his shoulder, a ruthless competitor who has cheated his way into more second-place finishes than any other car. He's been counting down the seasons to The King's retirement so that he can take over the coveted Dinoco sponsorship, but he never expected such fierce competition from hot shot rookie Lightning McQueen."" ""In Lightning McQueen's worst nightmares not only does Chick Hicks win the Piston Cup, but he wins over Dinoco as well."" Biography[] Cars[] Chick ties with The King and Lightning in the Piston Cup championship, forcing the three racers to compete in a tiebreaker race. Chick later mocks Lightning on winning the Piston Cup and sponsorship of Dinoco. Lightning retaliates by nicknaming Chick ""Thunder"" due to that thunder always comes after lightning, much to Chick's intense annoyance. He, however, later shows off with this new nickname after Lightning disappears in Radiator Springs, wooing his fans and stealing Lightning's. He makes numerous attempts to force Lightning out of the final race, only to be outrun by him in spite of it. King tries to prevent Chick from overtaking him, frustrating the latter. Refusing to finish behind King again, he intentionally sideswipes The King during the final lap, making him spin out of control and crash. When Lightning sees what has happened to The King, he stops before crossing the finish line and goes back to help The King across the line. This allows Chick to win first place and the Piston Cup. But nobody cheers him on, instead cheering on Lightning for helping The King. Shortly afterwards, as Chick egotistically gets on the victory podium to collect his trophy, the fans then turn on Chick, causing him to make a quick getaway and took his trophy away and making him realize the ""Chick era"" just ended as soon as it started. Outside of him presumably losing his fame, is unknown what happens to Chick afterwards, but it appears that he has been",1,1,1,1

Vichy France (French: Régime de Vichy; 10 July 1940 – 9 August 1944), officially the French State (État français), was a French puppet and rump state headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain during World War II. It was named after its seat of government, the city of Vichy. Officially independent, but with half of its territory occupied under the harsh terms of the 1940 armistice with Nazi Germany, it adopted a policy of collaboration. Though Paris was nominally its capital, the government established itself in the resort town of Vichy in the unoccupied ""free zone"" (zone libre), where it remained responsible for the civil administration of France as well as its colonies. The occupation of France by Nazi Germany at first affected only the northern and western portions of the country, but in November 1942 the Germans and Italians occupied the remainder of Metropolitan France, ending any pretence of independence by the Vichy government. The Third French Republic had begun the war in September 1939 on the side of the Allies. On 10 May 1940, it was invaded by Nazi Germany. The German Army rapidly broke through the Allied lines by bypassing the highly fortified Maginot Line and invading through Belgium, Luxembourg, and as an extension, the Ardennes. By mid-June, the military situation of the French was dire, and it was apparent that it would lose the battle for Metropolitan France. The French government began to discuss the possibility of an armistice. Paul Reynaud resigned as prime minister rather than sign an armistice, and was replaced by Marshal Philippe Pétain, a hero of World War I. Shortly thereafter, Pétain signed the Armistice of 22 June 1940. At Vichy, Pétain established an authoritarian government that reversed many liberal policies and began tight supervision of the economy. Conservative Catholics became prominent. The media were tightly controlled and promoted antisemitism and, after Operation Barbarossa started in June 1941, anti-Sovietism. The terms of the

economy. Conservative Catholics became prominent. The media were tightly controlled and promoted antisemitism and, after Operation Barbarossa started in June 1941, anti-Sovietism. The terms of the armistice allowed some degree of independence, France was officially declared a neutral country, and the Vichy government kept the French Navy and French colonial empire under French control, avoiding full occupation of the country by Germany. Despite heavy pressure, the Vichy government never joined the Axis powers. In October 1940, during a meeting with Adolf Hitler in Montoire sur le Loire, Petain officially announced the policy of collaboration with Germany while maintaining overall neutrality in the war, believing that improving relations with Germany would have been the only viable option to save France and preserve for it a dignified place within the context of New European Order shaped by the victorious Germany. The Vichy government believed that with its policy of collaboration, it could have extracted significant concessions from Germany and avoid harsh terms in the peace treaty. Germany kept two million French prisoners-of-war and imposed forced labour (service du travail obligatoire) on young Frenchmen. The Vichy government tried to negotiate with Germany for the early release of the French prisoners of war. French soldiers were kept hostage to ensure that Vichy would reduce its military forces and pay a heavy tribute in gold, food, and supplies to Germany. French police were ordered to round up Jews and other ""undesirables"" such as communists and political refugees, and at least 72,500 French Jews were killed in Nazi concentration camps. Most of the French public initially supported the regime, but opinion turned against the Vichy government and the occupying German forces as the war dragged on and living conditions in France worsened. Open opposition intensified as it became clear that Germany was losing the war. The French Resistance, working largely in",1,1,1,1
48,what led to stalin rise in power?,Revolution,"In 1912, Lenin, who was forced to flee the country, chose him to serve on the first Central Committee of the Bolshevik party, which had now broken from the Social Democrats.","Joseph Stalin started his career as a robber, gangster as well as an influential member and eventually the leader of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He served as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from April 3, 1922 until the official (and temporary) abolition of the office during the 19th Party Congress in October 1952 and absolute leader of the USSR from January 21, 1924 until his death on March 5, 1953. Stalin began his political activity after being exposed to Marxism and other left-wing thinkers while studying in a Georgian seminary. After being discovered in possession of radical literature, Stalin was expelled in 1899. He devoted himself to revolutionary activities and became a member of the anti-tsarist, Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP). Stalin joined the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin, whom he finally met in 1905. Tasked with raising money, Stalin resorted to criminal activity, Stalin took a leading role in the planning and execution of the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery. Following the October Revolution, Stalin was appointed leader of the People's Commissariat of Nationalities. He also took military positions in the Russian Civil War and Polish-Soviet War. Stalin was one of the Bolsheviks' chief operatives in the Caucasus and grew closer to Lenin, who saw him as tough and loyal, capable of getting things done behind the scenes. Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the 1921 Red Army invasion of Georgia. His successes in Georgia propelled him into the ranks of the Politburo in late 1921. At the 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1922, the leaders decided to expand the party's Central Committee. This decision led to the creation of the office of the General Secretary which Stalin assumed on 3 April. Stalin soon learned how to use his new office to gain advantages over key persons within the party. He prepared the agenda for

Active as a politico-military leader on various fronts during the Civil War of 1918-20, Stalin also held two ministerial posts in the new Bolshevik government, being commissar for nationalities (1917-23) and for state control (or workers' and peasants' inspection; 1919-23). But it was his position as secretary general of the party's Central Committee, from 1922 until his death, that provided the power base for his dictatorship. Besides heading the secretariat, he was also member of the powerful Politburo and of many other interlocking and overlapping committees--an arch-bureaucrat engaged in quietly outmaneuvering brilliant rivals, including Trotsky and Grigory Zinovyev, who despised such mundane organizational work. Because the pockmarked Georgian was so obviously unintellectual, they thought him unintelligent--a gross error, and one literally fatal in their case. From 1921 onward Stalin flouted the ailing Lenin's wishes, until, a year before his death, Lenin wrote a political ""testament,"" since widely publicized, calling for Stalin's removal from the secretary generalship; coming from Lenin, this document was potentially ruinous to Stalin's career, but his usual luck and skill enabled him to have it discounted during his lifetime.

ruthless organizer, he destroyed the remnants of individual freedom and failed to promote individual prosperity, yet he created a mighty military-industrial complex and led the Soviet Union into the nuclear age. GoriMonument of Joseph Stalin in front of the town hall in Gori, Georgia. Stalin's biography was long obscured by a mendacious Soviet-propagated ""legend"" exaggerating his prowess as a heroic Bolshevik boy-conspirator and faithful follower of Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union. In his prime, Stalin was hailed as a universal genius, as a ""shining sun,"" or ""the staff of life,"" and also as a ""great teacher and friend"" (especially of those communities he most savagely persecuted); once he was even publicly invoked as ""Our Father"" by a metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church. Achieving wide visual promotion through busts, statues, and icons of himself, the dictator became the object of a fanatical cult that, in private, he probably regarded with cynicism. Early years Stalin was of Georgian--not Russian--origin, and persistent rumours claim that he was Ossetian on the paternal side. He was the son of a poor cobbler in the provincial Georgian town of Gori in the Caucasus, then an imperial Russian colony. The drunken father savagely beat his son. Speaking only Georgian at home, Joseph learned Russian--which he always spoke with a guttural Georgian accent--while attending the church school at Gori (1888-94). He then moved to the Tiflis Theological Seminary, where he secretly read Karl Marx, the chief theoretician of international Communism, and other forbidden texts, being expelled in 1899 for revolutionary activity, according to the ""legend""--or leaving because of ill health, according to his doting mother. The mother, a devout washerwoman, had dreamed of her son becoming a priest, but Joseph Dzhugashvili was more ruffianly than clerical in appearance and outlook. He was short, stocky, black-haired, fierce-eyed, with one arm longer than the other, his

of the office of the General Secretary which Stalin assumed on 3 April. Stalin soon learned how to use his new office to gain advantages over key persons within the party. He prepared the agenda for the Politburo meetings, directing the course of meetings. As General Secretary, he appointed new local party leaders, establishing a patronage network loyal to him. In 1922, Lenin's health was rapidly deteriorating alongside his relationship with Stalin. Lenin and Trotsky had formed a bloc alliance to counter bureaucratisation of the party and the growing influence of Stalin. Lenin wrote a pamphlet, ""Lenin's Testament"", urging the party to remove Stalin as General Secretary fearing his authoritarianism. When Lenin died in 1924, the party was thrown into chaos and a vicious power struggle began. Stalin, through his office as General Secretary, received advanced knowledge about Lenin's Testament and sought to delay its release. Upon its release to the party, Stalin offered to resign as General Secretary, but this was rebuked to maintain the image of party unity. With his position secure, Stalin focused on consolidating his power and leveraging antagonisms among party leaders. Many were members of the Politburo, and rivalries extended beyond that. Several People's Commissars were involved in the Party's internal personal as well as political struggles. The main factions within the party included the intellectual ""left wing"", and the trade unionist ""right wing"". Leon Trotsky led a group of his own supporters. In this environment, Stalin painted himself as a moderate labeling his faction ""the centre"" while quietly building alliances with both sides in the mid-1920s. Stalin then pivoted to focus on Trotsky. Stalin forged an alliance with fellow Old Bolsheviks to oppose Trotsky in the party apparatus. Defeating Trotsky was difficult as he had a prominent role in the October Revolution. Trotsky developed the Red Army and played an indispensable role during the Russian Civil

Tammerfors (now Tampere, Finland; 1905), Stockholm (1906), and London (1907)--without making much impression. But he was active behind the scenes, helping to plot a spectacular holdup in Tiflis (now Tbilisi) on June 25 (June 12, Old Style), 1907, in order to ""expropriate"" funds for the party. His first big political promotion came in February (January, Old Style) 1912, when Lenin--now in emigration--co-opted him to serve on the first Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party, which had finally broken with the other Social Democrats. In the following year, Dzhugashvili published, at Lenin's behest, an important article on Marxism and the national question. By now he had adopted the name Stalin, deriving from Russian stal (""steel""); he also briefly edited the newly founded Bolshevik newspaper Pravda before undergoing his longest period of exile: in Siberia from July 1913 to March 1917. In about 1904 Stalin had married a pious Georgian girl, Ekaterina Svanidze. She died some three years later and left a son, Jacob, whom his father treated with contempt, calling him a weakling after an unsuccessful suicide attempt in the late 1920s; when Jacob was taken prisoner by the Germans during World War II, Stalin refused a German offer to exchange his son. Reaching Petrograd from Siberia on March 25 (March 12, Old Style), 1917, Stalin resumed editorship of Pravda. He briefly advocated Bolshevik cooperation with the provisional government of middle-class liberals that had succeeded to uneasy power on the last tsar's abdication during the February Revolution. But under Lenin's influence, Stalin soon switched to the more-militant policy of armed seizure of power by the Bolsheviks. When their coup d'etat occurred in November (October, Old Style) 1917, he played an important role, but one less prominent than that of his chief rival, Leon Trotsky. Active as a politico-military leader on various fronts during the Civil War of 1918-20, Stalin also held two ministerial posts in the new",1,1,1,4
49,who wrote st trinians?,Simon Kinberg,Ronald Searle,"St Trinian's is a 2007 British comedy film and the sixth in a long-running series of British films based on the works of cartoonist Ronald Searle and set in St Trinian's School. The first five films form a series, starting with The Belles of St. Trinian's in 1954, with sequels in 1957, 1960, 1966 and a reboot in 1980. The release of 2007, 27 years after the last entry, and 53 years after the first film, is a rebooting of the franchise, rather than a direct sequel, with certain plot elements borrowed from the first film. Whereas the earlier films concentrated on the adults, this film gives the school pupils greater prominence. St Trinian's is an anarchic school for uncontrollable girls run by eccentric headmistress Camilla Dagey Fritton (the reboot continues the tradition, established by Alastair Sim in the original film, of casting a male actor to play the female headmistress, with Rupert Everett inheriting the role). St Trinian's received mixed reviews but remains one of the highest-grossing British independent films of the last thirty years. == Plot == Annabelle Fritton, an uptight daddy's girl, unwillingly transfers to St Trinian's from the distinguished Cheltenham Ladies' College at the request of her father, Carnaby Fritton. Annabelle is resentful and insulting, telling her father that the school is ""like Hogwarts for pikeys"". She is taken around the school by Kelly Jones, the head girl, who introduces her to the various cliques within the school; Chavs, Posh Totty, Geeks, Emo and First Years. Annabelle is harassed and pranked by the girls while in the shower and a video of her running around the school naked and wet is broadcast live on the internet. After a phone argument with her father she is drafted to the hockey team when she hits her phone with her hockey stick, smashing a statue. The girls of St Trinian's are involved in business with spiv Flash Harry, who pays them to make cheap vodka. Flash is shown to be romantically interested in Kelly, who

The Belles of St Trinian's is a 1954 British comedy film, directed by Frank Launder, co-written by Launder and Sidney Gilliat, and starring Alastair Sim, Joyce Grenfell, George Cole, Hermione Baddeley. Inspired by British cartoonist Ronald Searle's St Trinian's School comic strips, the film focuses on students and teachers of the fictional school, dealing with attempts to shut it down while the headmistress faces financial troubles, which culminates in students thwarting a scheme involving a racehorse. The film was among the most popular British films of 1954, critics praising the comedy and several of the cast, including Sim's dual role as the headmistress, Miss Millicent Fritton, and her twin brother, Clarence Fritton. The film was the first of the St. Trinian's series – three sequels were later produced: Blue Murder at St Trinian's (1957); The Pure Hell of St Trinian's (1960); and The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery (1966). == Plot == The Sultan of Makyad enrols his daughter Fatima at St. Trinian's – a girls' school in England, run by its headmistress Millicent Fritton. She discovers that Millicent prepares her students to succeed in a merciless world by fighting authoritative figures in the police and government. Many of the girls are unruly and have criminal relations; as a result, the curriculum focuses on crime and illicit schemes, all while the students thwart efforts by the local police and the Ministry of Education (the government department now called the Department for Education) to shut the school. Millicent, however, faces problems as St. Trinian's is on the verge of bankruptcy, and seeks any means to clear the school's debt. Millicent's twin, bookmaker Clarence Fritton, visits the school to check in on his sister and learns about Fatima. Knowing that her father owns a horse due to take part in a major race, Clarence enrols his daughter, Arabella, with instructions to befriend Fatima and extract information about the horse.

Flash is shown to be romantically interested in Kelly, who initially turns him down. The Cheltenham Ladies' College hockey team arrive at St Trinian's, along with Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites. Thwaites is shown to have romantic history with the headmistress of St Trinian's, Camilla Fritton. Annabelle is forced to face her former bullies, including captain Verity Thwaites. The hockey match is violent, ending in Kelly shooting a winning goal for St Trinian's, and she begins to fit in with the other girls. As the match is being played, Thwaites inspects the school, finding the illegal vodka-making business and the chatline being run by the Posh Totty clique. The following morning, a banker arrives at the school and serves Camilla with a foreclosure notice, as the school owes the bank in excess of £500,000 and has ignored six previous final demands. A subsequent meeting between Camilla and Carnaby is watched by the girls using hidden cameras, in which Carnaby confesses his distaste towards his daughter. Annabelle is clearly upset, despite Camilla defending her. Carnaby encourages Camilla to turn the school into a boutique hotel, telling her that ""when this school closes down, you'll have lost everything. More importantly, so will I."" Kelly and Flash work with the students to devise a plan to save the school. They must get into the final of School Challenge, a TV quiz show held in the National Gallery in London, as a cover for stealing Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring.

At the same time, local police superintendent Kemp Bird assigns sergeant Ruby Gates, with whom he is in a relationship, to infiltrate the school as a games mistress, while the Ministry assigns Manton Bassett to send in a new inspector to St. Trinian's after two others disappeared – unaware that they now work at the school. Clarence learns from Arabella that the Sultan's horse is likely to win. Arabella suggests to her father that her gang can incapacitate the stable boy and abduct the horse, hiding it until the race is over. At the same time, several girls report the horse's performance to Millicent, who places a wager via the spiv, 'Flash' Harry. When Fatima discovers Arabella leading sixth-form girls to kidnap the horse, she leads her fourth-form classmates to recover the animal and smuggle it back to the racecourse before the race. As the police and Ministry are embarrassed by failing to prevent trouble, the girls ensure the horse wins. As Millicent is berated by the girl's parents over the way she runs the school, Harry arrives to say the win has netted the school the money it needs to stay open, to her relief. == Cast == Ronald Searle appeared in a cameo role as a visiting parent. Roger Delgado plays the Sultan's aide. It was also the first film appearance of Barbara Windsor, then a teenager. == Production == The film was based on the cartoons of Ronald Searle. He started doing sketches at the beginning of the war and continued to do them as a POW in Singapore. After the war they became very successful. By the time the film was made Searle had become tired of them. === Filming === Filming took place in April–May 1954.

writer and biographer of his father, John Sharp, Archbishop of York. Judith was the daughter of travel writer George Wheler and Grace née Higgons, who grew up in the political household of Sir Thomas Higgons. Sharp was born in Durham in 1735. He had eight older brothers and five younger sisters. Five of his brothers survived their infancy and by the time Sharp had reached his midteens the family funds set aside for their education had been all but depleted, so Sharp was educated at Durham School but mainly at home. He was apprenticed to a London linen-draper at the age of fifteen. Sharp loved to argue and debate, and his keen intellect found little outlet in the mundane work in which he was involved. However, one of his fellow-apprentices was Socinian (a Unitarian sect that denied the divinity of Christ), and in order better to argue, Sharp taught himself Greek. Another fellow apprentice was Jewish, and so Sharp learned Hebrew in order to be able to discuss theological matters with his colleague. Sharp also conducted genealogical research for one of his masters, Henry Willoughby, who had a claim to the barony of Willoughby de Parham, and it was through Sharp's work that Willoughby was able to take his place in the House of Lords. Sharp's apprenticeship ended in 1757, and both his parents died soon after. That same year he accepted a position as Clerk in the Ordnance Office at the Tower of London. This civil service position allowed him plenty of free time to pursue his scholarly and intellectual pursuits. Sharp had a keen musical interest. Four of his siblings – William, later to become surgeon to George III, James, Elizabeth and Judith – had also come to London, and they met every day. They all played musical instruments as a family orchestra, giving concerts at William's house in Mincing Lane and later in the family sailing barge, Apollo, which was moored at the Bishop of London's steps in Fulham, near William's country home, Fulham House.

Morrison played for three years at Gonzaga University and was considered to be one of the top college basketball players in 2005–06. He was a finalist for the Naismith and the Wooden Award. He was named Co-Player of the Year with Duke's JJ Redick by the United States Basketball Writers Association and won the 2006 Chevrolet Player of the Year award. He played for the Charlotte Bobcats from 2006 to 2009, and for the L.A. Lakers from 2009 to 2010, where he won two NBA Championships. == Early life == Morrison's father, John, worked as a basketball coach, and the family moved with his coaching career: Casper College in Casper, Wyoming, Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota, and Dawson Community College in Glendive, Montana. When Morrison was in the fourth grade, his father left coaching, and the family moved to Spokane, Washington. Adam became the Gonzaga men's team's ball boy. When he was in the eighth grade, he lost 30 pounds (14 kg), and while attending a basketball camp at Gonzaga during this time, he felt sick, later saying about his experience at the camp, ""I think I made one shot the whole three days. I was sicker than a dog. I didn't want to play. I couldn't do anything."" Shortly after this, Morrison was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. He took his diagnosis surprisingly well; the second time a nurse came to administer insulin, he stopped her, telling her, ""Since I'm going to be doing this the rest of my life, you might as well show me how to do it."" However, his illness did not keep him from becoming a star at Mead Senior High School in Spokane. In his senior year he broke single-season and career scoring records in his high school conference, and led Mead to the finals of the state tournament. Despite playing in the final game with hypoglycemia so severe that he nearly had a seizure, he scored 37 points in a losing effort. It was Mead's only loss that

Adam Morrison - Workouts with basically every NBA team over the summer eventually culminated in a training camp contract with the Washington Wizards, yet that in turn eventually culminated on losing out on a roster spot to Cartier Martin. Morrison is unsigned, not in the D-League nor anywhere, and would probably do well to suck it up and go to the D-League. The prorated $25,000 salary is a far cry from the $5.5 million he earned last year, but if he treats it like summer league (and produces as if it was summer league as well), then that might represent his one chance at a ticket back. In spite of everything else, Morrison is not talentless. Martin was a part of the small forward rotation at the very end of last season, playing decent defense and chipping in 6 points per game during the garbage time that was Washington's month of April. He's joined by Morrison, the oft-chronicled and seriously unsuccessful player, who continues to struggle with the awkward reality that he's better at hitting tough shots than open ones, without being good enough of a player to justify taking any tough ones. And considering that the only thing he's good at is scoring, this would be the reason why Adam Morrison's career thus far has been spectacularly underwhelming. The knee injury didn't help, but that's not what caused all this. Adam Morrison - Morrison is one of the biggest draft busts of all time. He can make tough shots, but because of how unbelievably unathletic he is, every shot is a tough shot. Morrison can't play defense, doesn't want to rebound or pass, and seems to make every shot harder for no obvious reason. On the rare occasions that he gets to play, he continues to take the kind of shots that he took in college, but without the justification for doing so any more. The resulting concoction is just not a good player. The only ability he has is one he shouldn't really be utilising.

Standing Behind ""The Stache"": NBA's Adam Morrison At the 2006 NBA Draft, Adam dons his new team cap as his parents, Wanda and John Morrison, stand proudly by him. Miami, FL (November 2006) -- Wanda and John Morrison have mastered the art of teamwork. It's apparent in conversation as each finishes the other's last sentence. Maybe it stems from a solid foundation and 32 years of married life. Perhaps it ripened over time as they raised three children together, or sprung from necessity when their youngest was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Wherever it originated, this warm and loving couple has passed the asset along to their kids, and especially to their youngest child, Adam Morrison, 22. Selected by the Charlotte Bobcats as the third overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft, Adam has taken this team mentality to a whole new level, while overcoming the challenges of this disease. ""There are several professional athletes that play a variety of sports, and they have diabetes,"" said John of his son. ""I think being into athletics has actually helped Adam stay in control of this disease - the discipline, the practice, his work ethic, and tenacity. He refuses to lose."" Despite diabetes, Adam was the third overall pick in the NBA draft. As Adam is quickly rising to household name status, his parents look back upon his diagnosis, their family's strength and solidarity, and their commitment to their son and his future. A family history of diabetes... On May 2, 1999, the devastating news of Adam's diagnosis came as no surprise. Type 1 diabetes has affected both sides of the family and even the Morrisons' beloved dog, Megan, suffered with the disease. ""Diabetes is not the death sentence it was for my mother. The technology was nowhere near where it is today,"" said Wanda, who lost her mother to diabetes complications. John's grandfather also suffered with the disease and the loss of a limb. From a young age, Adam and their two daughters, Brandie, 28, and Sara, 25, were keenly aware

to the finals of the state tournament. Despite playing in the final game with hypoglycemia so severe that he nearly had a seizure, he scored 37 points in a losing effort. It was Mead's only loss that season. Morrison was not heavily recruited out of high school. Dave Telep of scout.com admitted, ""In one of the biggest misses of my career, we left him off the Top 100 list. We ranked him the No. 26 small forward. The goal is to never make a mistake of that magnitude again"". == College career == Morrison arrived at Gonzaga University to play for the Gonzaga Bulldogs in 2003. In his freshman year he averaged 11.4 points per game (ppg), with a season-high 22 points against St. Mary's. Gonzaga won the West Coast Conference (WCC) regular-season title. Morrison was named to the WCC All-Freshman Team. In his sophomore year Morrison averaged 19.0 ppg. He scored a season-high 28 points at home against San Francisco, including the winning shot with 0.6 seconds to play in the game. Gonzaga again won the WCC regular-season title. Morrison made the All-WCC First Team and was selected to the Basketball Times All-West Coast Team as well as being named an honorable mention Associated Press All-American. In his junior year during Gonzaga's first two games of the 2005–06 season at the Maui Invitational, Morrison played well against two of the sport's top programs. In the first round, Morrison scored 25 points in a Gonzaga win over Maryland. He followed up this performance with 43 points in a triple-overtime win over Michigan State in the semifinals. He matched that output against in-state rival Washington on December 4, 2005, in a losing effort. However, Morrison and the Zags bounced back a week later, defeating Oklahoma State after he banked in a three-pointer with 2.5 seconds left to give Gonzaga a two-point lead and eventually the win. In the regular season, he had 13 games of 30-plus points, with five of them over 40. At 28.1 points per game, he was the nation's leading scorer in

to diabetes complications. John's grandfather also suffered with the disease and the loss of a limb. From a young age, Adam and their two daughters, Brandie, 28, and Sara, 25, were keenly aware that there was a family history of diabetes. ""We were never untruthful with our children."" The undeniable signs surfaced after their 14-year-old battled a bout with the flu. At the John R. Wooden Award Ceremony, Wanda and John pose with their son, who was one of the top ten Wooden All-Americans and one of five finalists for this prestigious award. ""I made him stay home from a tournament, which, to Adam, was worse than death. I really feel that incident is where his genes took a wrong turn,"" said Wanda of the illness. ""He lost weight, drank a lot of water, and was using the bathroom a lot. John and I could tell this wasn't going to be good."" A trip to the emergency room confirmed what they already knew in their hearts. ""He was such a trooper. He didn't even cry,"" Wanda insisted, but beyond the tough exterior, she could see that Adam's mind was reeling. She imagined that he was contemplating his life and future, the possible end to a career in sports, and even death. Talking about Megan helped make the moment a little lighter, however, it was Adam's doctor who extinguished his most inconceivable fear in an instant with just a few words, ""You can still play basketball."" The Morrisons watched the tension in their son's face drain - the diagnosis rendered bearable once he realized that he could continue to strive for his dream. ""There was no way we could discourage him after that,"" said Wanda. During the first few weeks after Adam's diagnosis, the Morrison family made the necessary changes to their lifestyle, eliminating the cookies from the cabinets and ice cream from the freezer. Since they were a healthy, athletic bunch, well-balanced meals were always on the menu, and fast food was never the norm. However, John described that first trip to the grocery store as rather",1,1,5,1
51,where did kennedy's inaugural address take place?,Capitol,John F. Kennedy 1961 presidential inauguration,"The inauguration of John F. Kennedy as the 35th president of the United States was held on Friday, January 20, 1961, at the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. This was the 44th inauguration and marked the commencement of John F. Kennedy's and Lyndon B. Johnson's only term as president and vice president. Kennedy was assassinated 2 years, 306 days into this term, and Johnson succeeded to the presidency. Kennedy had narrowly defeated Richard Nixon, the incumbent vice president, in the presidential election. Kennedy was the first Catholic to become president, the youngest person elected to the office, and the first U.S. president to have been born in the 20th century. His inaugural address encompassed the major themes of his campaign and would define his presidency during a time of economic prosperity, emerging social changes, and diplomatic challenges. This inauguration was the first in which a poet, Robert Frost, participated in the program. For this inauguration, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies was chaired by Senator John Sparkman, and included Senators Carl Hayden and Styles Bridges, and Representatives Sam Rayburn, John W. McCormack, and Charles A. Halleck. == Sinatra inaugural ball == Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized and hosted a pre-inaugural ball at the D.C. Armory on the eve of Inauguration day, January 19, 1961, considered one of the biggest parties ever held in the history of Washington, D.C. Sinatra recruited many Hollywood stars who performed and attended, and went as far as convincing Broadway theatres to suspend their shows for the night to accommodate some of their actors attending the gala. With tickets ranging from $100 per person to $10,000 per group, Sinatra hoped to raise $1.7 million ($17.3 million in today's dollars) for the Democratic Party to eliminate its debt brought on by a hard-fought campaign. Many Hollywood stars gave brief speeches or performed acts, rehearsed by Kay Thompson

million in today's dollars) for the Democratic Party to eliminate its debt brought on by a hard-fought campaign. Many Hollywood stars gave brief speeches or performed acts, rehearsed by Kay Thompson and directed by Roger Edens, and stayed at the Statler-Hilton Hotel where preparations and rehearsals were photographed by Phil Stern. Performances and speeches included Fredric March, Sidney Poitier, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Gene Kelly, Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, Bill Dana, Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante, Harry Belafonte, and Sinatra himself. Sammy Davis Jr., a long-time friend of Sinatra, supporter of the Democratic Party, and member of the Rat Pack, was asked by John F. Kennedy not to attend the gala at the behest of his father Joseph, fearing that his interracial marriage to Swedish actress May Britt was too controversial for the time and occasion, much to Sammy's and Sinatra's dismay. Davis had already postponed his wedding to Britt until after the election, also at the request of the Kennedy campaign via Sinatra. Davis eventually switched his support to the Republican Party and Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. Harry Belafonte expressed sadness at the controversy, stating ""It was the ambassador, [but] we didn't know that until after. Sammy not being there was a loss."" At the end of the ball, Kennedy spoke to thank Sinatra on the festivities and his support of the Democratic Party throughout his life and the 1960 campaign, adding ""The happy relationship between the arts and politics which has characterized our long history I think reached culmination tonight."" Jacqueline retired to the White House before the ball ended at 1:30 am (ET), and John went to a second pre-inaugural ball hosted by his father Joseph Kennedy, and would finally return to the White House at around 3:30 am. == The inaugural nor'easter == A major winter storm occurred the day before the inauguration, with temperatures at 20 °F (−7 °C) and snowfall at 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) per hour and a

Between 73 and 79 days after the presidential election, the president-elect of the United States is inaugurated as president by taking the presidential oath of office. The inauguration takes place for each new presidential term, even if the president is continuing in office for another term. The first inauguration of George Washington took place on April 30, 1789. All subsequent public inaugurations from 1793 until 1933 were held on March 4, except in 1821, 1849, 1877, and 1917, when March 4 fell on a Sunday and the public inauguration ceremony took place on Monday, March 5. Since 1937, it has taken place at noon EST on January 20, the first day of the new term, except in 1957, 1985, and 2013, when January 20 fell on a Sunday. In those years, the presidential oath of office was administered on that day privately and then again in a public ceremony the next day, on Monday, January 21. Those inaugurations, each 28 years apart, were all coincidentally the re-inauguration of the incumbent president to a second and final term. The most recent presidential inauguration was held on January 20, 2021, when Joe Biden assumed office. Recitation of the presidential oath of office is the only component in this ceremony mandated by the United States Constitution (in Article II, Section One, Clause 8). Though it is not a constitutional requirement, the chief justice of the United States typically administers the presidential oath of office. Since 1789, the oath has been administered at 59 scheduled public inaugurations, by 15 chief justices, one associate justice, and one New York state judge. Others, in addition to the chief justice, have administered the oath of office to several of the nine vice presidents who have succeeded to the presidency upon their predecessor's death or resignation intra-term. Since the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan, the ceremony has been held at the west front of the United States Capitol facing the National Mall with its iconic Washington Monument

intra-term. Since the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan, the ceremony has been held at the west front of the United States Capitol facing the National Mall with its iconic Washington Monument and distant Lincoln Memorial. From 1829 through 1977, most swearing-in ceremonies had taken place on a platform over the steps at the Capitol's east portico. They have also been held inside the Old Senate Chamber, the chamber of the House of Representatives, and the Capitol rotunda. The most recent regularly scheduled inauguration not to take place at the Capitol was the fourth inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, which was held at the White House. Over the years, various traditions have arisen that have expanded the inauguration from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long event, including parades and multiple social gatherings. The ceremony itself is carried live via the major U.S. commercial television and cable news networks; various ones also stream it live on their websites. When a president has assumed office intra-term, the inauguration ceremony has been conducted without pomp or fanfare. To facilitate a quick presidential transition under extraordinary circumstances, the new president takes the oath of office in a simple ceremony and usually addresses the nation afterward. This has happened nine times in United States history: eight times after the previous president had died while in office, and once after the previous president had resigned. == Inauguration ceremonies == === Dates === The first inauguration, that of George Washington, took place on April 30, 1789. All subsequent (regular) inaugurations from 1793 until 1933, were held on March 4, the day of the year on which the federal government began operations under the U.S. Constitution in 1789. The exception to this pattern was those years in which March 4 fell on a Sunday. When it did, the public inauguration ceremony would take place on Monday, March 5. This happened on four occasions, in 1821,

Gettysburg Address On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his most famous speech at the dedication of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg. His now-iconic Gettysburg Address eloquently transformed the Union cause into a struggle for liberty and equality--in only 272 words. He ended with the following: ""From these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""

52,where did the second battle of ypres occur?,Ypres,Belgium,"The First Battle of Ypres (French: Première Bataille des Flandres, German: Erste Flandernschlacht, 19 October – 22 November 1914) was a battle of the First World War, fought on the Western Front around Ypres, in West Flanders, Belgium. The battle was part of the First Battle of Flanders, in which German, French, Belgian armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fought from Arras in France to Nieuwpoort (Nieuport) on the Belgian coast, from 10 October to mid-November. The battles at Ypres began at the end of the Race to the Sea, reciprocal attempts by the German and Franco-British armies to advance past the northern flank of their opponents. North of Ypres, the fighting continued in the Battle of the Yser (16–31 October), between the German 4th Army, the Belgian army and French marines. The fighting has been divided into five stages, an encounter battle from 19 to 21 October, the Battle of Langemarck from 21 to 24 October, the battles at La Bassée and Armentières to 2 November, coincident with more Allied attacks at Ypres and the Battle of Gheluvelt (29–31 October), a fourth phase with the last big German offensive, which culminated at the Battle of Nonne Bosschen on 11 November, then local operations which faded out in late November. Brigadier-General James Edmonds, the British official historian, wrote in the History of the Great War, that the II Corps battle at La Bassée could be taken as separate but that the battles from Armentières to Messines and Ypres, were better understood as one battle in two parts, an offensive by III Corps and the Cavalry Corps from 12 to 18 October against which the Germans retired and an offensive by the German 6th Army and 4th Army from 19 October to 2 November, which from 30 October, took place mainly north of the Lys, when the battles of Armentières and Messines merged with the Battles of Ypres. Attacks by the BEF (Field Marshal Sir John French) the Belgians and the French Eighth Army in Belgium made little progress beyond

battles of Armentières and Messines merged with the Battles of Ypres. Attacks by the BEF (Field Marshal Sir John French) the Belgians and the French Eighth Army in Belgium made little progress beyond Ypres. The German 4th and 6th Armies took small amounts of ground, at great cost to both sides, during the Battle of the Yser and further south at Ypres. General Erich von Falkenhayn, head of the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, the German General Staff), then tried a limited offensive to capture Ypres and Mont Kemmel (Kemmelberg), from 19 October to 22 November. Neither side had moved forces to Flanders fast enough to obtain a decisive victory and by November both sides were exhausted. The armies were short of ammunition, suffering from low morale and some infantry units refused orders. The autumn battles in Flanders had become static, attrition operations, unlike the battles of manoeuvre in the summer. French, British and Belgian troops, in improvised field defences, repulsed German attacks for four weeks. From 21 to 23 October, German reservists had made mass attacks at Langemarck (Langemark), with losses of up to 70 per cent, to little effect. Warfare between mass armies, equipped with the weapons of the Industrial Revolution and its later developments, proved to be indecisive, because field fortifications neutralised many classes of offensive weapon. The defensive firepower of artillery and machine guns dominated the battlefield and the ability of the armies to supply themselves and replace casualties prolonged battles for weeks. Thirty-four German divisions fought in the Flanders battles, against twelve French, nine British and six Belgian divisions, along with marines and dismounted cavalry. Over the winter, Falkenhayn reconsidered Germany strategy because Vernichtungsstrategie and the imposition of a dictated peace on France and Russia had exceeded German resources. Falkenhayn devised a new strategy to detach either Russia or France from the Allied coalition through

The Battle of Verdun (French: Bataille de Verdun [bataj də vɛʁdœ̃]; German: Schlacht um Verdun [ʃlaxt ʔʊm ˈvɛɐ̯dœ̃]) was fought from 21 February to 18 December 1916 on the Western Front in France. The battle was the longest of the First World War and took place on the hills north of Verdun. The German 5th Army attacked the defences of the Fortified Region of Verdun (RFV, Région Fortifiée de Verdun) and those of the French Second Army on the right (east) bank of the Meuse. Using the experience of the Second Battle of Champagne in 1915, the Germans planned to capture the Meuse Heights, an excellent defensive position, with good observation for artillery-fire on Verdun. The Germans hoped that the French would commit their strategic reserve to recapture the position and suffer catastrophic losses at little cost to the German infantry. Poor weather delayed the beginning of the attack until 21 February but the Germans captured Fort Douaumont in the first three days. The advance then slowed for several days, despite inflicting many French casualties. By 6 March, 20+1⁄2 French divisions were in the RFV and a more extensive defence in depth had been organised. Philippe Pétain ordered there to be no retreat and that German attacks were to be counter-attacked, despite this exposing French infantry to the German artillery. By 29 March, French guns on the west bank had begun a constant bombardment of Germans on the east bank, causing many infantry casualties. The German offensive was extended to the west bank of the Meuse to gain observation and eliminate the French artillery firing over the river but the attacks failed to reach their objectives. In early May, the Germans changed tactics again and made local attacks and counter-attacks; the French recaptured part of Fort Douaumont but the Germans ejected them and took many prisoners. The Germans tried alternating their attacks on either side of the Meuse and in June captured Fort Vaux. The Germans advanced towards the last

but the Germans ejected them and took many prisoners. The Germans tried alternating their attacks on either side of the Meuse and in June captured Fort Vaux. The Germans advanced towards the last geographical objectives of the original plan, at Fleury-devant-Douaumont and Fort Souville, driving a salient into the French defences. Fleury was captured and the Germans came within 2.5 mi (4 km) of the Verdun citadel but in July the offensive was limited to provide troops, artillery and ammunition for the Battle of the Somme, leading to a similar transfer of the French Tenth Army to the Somme front. From 23 June to 17 August, Fleury changed hands sixteen times and a German attack on Fort Souville failed. The offensive was reduced further but to keep French troops away from the Somme, ruses were used to disguise the change. In September and December, French counter-offensives recaptured much ground on the east bank and recovered Fort Douaumont and Fort Vaux. The battle lasted for 302 days, one of the longest and costliest in human history. In 2000, Hannes Heer and Klaus Naumann calculated that the French suffered 377,231 casualties and the Germans 337,000, a total of 714,231 and an average of 70,000 a month. In 2014, William Philpott wrote of 714,000 casualties suffered by both sides during the Battle of Verdun in 1916 and that about 1,250,000 casualties were suffered in the vicinity of Verdun in the war. In France, the battle came to symbolise the determination of the French Army and the destructiveness of the war. == Background == === Strategic developments === After the German invasion of France had been halted at the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, the war of movement ended at the Battle of the Yser and the First Battle of Ypres. The Germans built field fortifications to hold the ground captured in 1914 and the French began siege warfare to break through the German defences and recover the lost territory. In late 1914 and in 1915, offensives on the

World War I or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as in parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific, and in Europe was characterised by trench warfare; the widespread use of artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas); and the introductions of tanks and aircraft. World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 10 million military dead and more than 20 million wounded, plus some 10 million civilian dead from causes including genocide. The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic. The causes of World War I included the rise of Germany and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the long-standing balance of power in Europe, as well as economic competition between nations triggered by industrialisation and imperialism. Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia and France, who had an alliance. The United Kingdom entered after Germany invaded Belgium, whose neutrality it guaranteed, and the Ottomans joined the Central Powers in November. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France, then to transfer its forces to the east, but its advance was halted in September, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side gained a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and",2,1,1,1

was remarried to 23-year-old Mary Ball. Childhood & Education Mary Ball Washington gave birth to her firstborn son at Wakefield at 10 a.m. on 22 February 1732. His name was George. His birth would be followed by five younger siblings: Elizabeth (1733-1797), Samuel (1734-1781), John Augustine (1736-1787), Charles (1738-1799), and Mildred (1739-1740). In 1734, Augustine moved his rapidly growing family 60 miles (96 km) up the Potomac River to the Little Hunting Creek plantation, where he could keep a closer eye on his lucrative ironworks. He ordered the construction of a house on this property that would form the basis for Mount Vernon. Before long, Augustine moved the family once again, this time to the Ferry Farm estate near Fredericksburg, Virginia; it was here where George Washington spent much of his youth. The supposed instance in which George Washington was unable to lie to his father about chopping down a prized cherry tree was later fabricated. Not much is known about George's childhood; indeed, in terms of historical scholarship, it remains the murkiest chapter of his life. He was certainly raised on the Ferry Farm plantation, and likely attended a local school in Fredericksburg, where he excelled in the subjects of geometry, trigonometry, and mapmaking. Some of his school papers survive, in which he copied out sets of moral teachings from the book Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation; these 'rules', which included such counsel as ""in the presence of others, sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet"", showed George how to be a proper Virginian gentleman, guidance he would follow for the rest of his life. Folkloric stories about George's childhood - such as the supposed instance in which he was unable to lie to his father about chopping down a prized cherry tree - were later fabricated, to fill in the gaps in this unknown part of his life. In 1743, Augustine Washington unexpectedly died. At

Goose and From Kansas to Fairyland (later published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). By dint of Frank's literary successes, Maud and Frank were financially secure enough to tour Egypt and Europe for six months. Since Frank was frequently occupied with penning stories for his publishers, Maud was the one who wrote numerous letters home. These letters were later published in 1907 as In Other Lands Than Ours for friends and family. After Frank died, she authorized Ruth Plumly Thompson to write more Oz sequels and helped promote MGM's film The Wizard of Oz (1939). In 1953, she died at 91 years of age, surviving her husband by 34 years. == Early life == Born on March 27, 1861 to Matilda Joslyn Gage and Henry Hill Gage Maud was the youngest of their four children. She had two sisters, Helen Leslie Gage and Julia Gage Carpenter, and a brother, Thomas Clarkson Gage. Her mother was a feminist who fought for women's rights, and her father was a prosperous dry-goods retailer. A relative noted that Maud's mother was a ""woman of force"" who ""ruled her mild, gentle husband and her four children with a rod of iron"". Maud lived with her parents in a Greek Revival home in Fayetteville, New York. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz wrote that Maud had ""dark hair, a shapely figure, and eyes as sharp as her mind"". In her youth, Maud went to a boys' high school. Both she and her future husband, L. Frank Baum, attended Syracuse Classical School, a preparatory school in Syracuse, New York. In September 1880, Maud headed to Cornell University, leaving on a train and arriving at an Ithaca depot two hours later. Her brother, Clarkson, had graduated as one of the top of the class, though her elder sisters did not attend a university. When Maud arrived at the university, she intended to be the family's first woman to receive a complete degree. Her mother dreamed of her becoming a doctor or a lawyer, which would be a rare accomplishment for a woman. Though Maud had very little knowledge about being on

54,when will the world end mayans?,2012,2012,"Remember 2012? That was the year that Lonesome George died, NASA's Curiosity rover landed on Mars, and Felix Baumgartner skydived from the edge of space. It was also the year of the biggest anti-climax in history as the world failed to end on December 21 - the date that, according to some, the Maya had foreseen the apocalypse. Advertisement In truth, the ancient Mesoamerican civilization made no such prediction, and archaeological findings suggest that the Maya actually expected the world to continue to exist indefinitely. Their calendar, though, did come to the end of a major cycle in late 2012, leading to New Age misinterpretations about the end of days. Advertisement The End Of The Mayan Calendar? The Maya were expert timekeepers and, like us, divided the passage of time into recurring periods. Rather than counting in neat centuries and millennia, though, the Mayan calendar consisted of two interlocking systems known as the Haab - which consisted of 365 days - and the 260-day Tzolkin. Making modern imperial units of measurement seem positively straightforward, the Mayan calendar tracked both of these timetables simultaneously until they finally aligned every 52 years. Scheduling events further ahead than this was therefore not possible, which is why the Maya also devised the so-called Long Count calendar. Each Long Count consisted of 5,126 years and was split into 13 equal segments of roughly 394 years, known as Bak'tuns. The Maya began counting the previous Long Count on August 11, 3114 BCE, which means the 13th Bak'tun of that cycle was due to end on December 21, 2012. As with our own timekeeping systems, the end of Long Count was immediately followed by the start of the next, and there is no indication in the archaeological record that the Maya expected time to grind to a halt when any given cycle came to a close. However, in 1987, author Jose Arguelles published a book in which he wrongly interpreted the Mayan calendar as a countdown to the end of time,

bʼakʼtuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."" In 1966, Michael D. Coe wrote in The Maya that ""there is a suggestion ... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [bʼakʼtun]. Thus ... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."" === Objec

the 2012 finale. When re-analyzing Tortuguero Monument 6 a few years later, both Stuart and Houston concluded that the inscription probably wasn't referring to any event succeeding the end of the Long Count after all, but was simply documenting the dedication of the shrine on January 11, 669. The scribe, they say, identified the date by counting backward from the 13th Bak'tun. The monument, therefore, does not describe the end of the world, but simply references the conclusion of the Long Cycle as a means of keeping track of time. So What Did The Maya Believe? The Maya fully expected a new Bak'tun to begin when the previous one came to an end. No judgement day, no planetary implosion, and certainly no alien rescuers are referenced in any of their surviving artifacts - and they had no doubt that the sun would rise as normal on December 22, 2012. Advertisement Luckily, researchers found definitive proof for the continuation of life as we know it just in time to put people's minds at rest. In May 2012, archaeologists in Xultun, Guatemala, unearthed the oldest and most complete Mayan astronomical tables ever discovered. These calendars stretched at least 7,000 years into the future, indicating that the Maya didn't simply stop counting at 2012. Like all other Mayan timekeeping systems, the newly discovered calendars are likely to represent cycles that repeat ad infinitum. In other words, the ancient civilization that is most synonymous with apocalyptic predictions actually thought the world would never end.

the year 2000 will occur, the Yankees won the World Series."" Written this way, Stuart notes, the text mentions a future time of historical importance--the 50-year anniversary of the victory--but it does so in reference to the event at hand, i.e., the 1950 game. ""This is precisely how many ancient Maya texts are structured, including Tortuguero's Monument 6,"" Stuart writes. 2012 Apocalypse Just Poetic Flourish According to INAH's Gallaga, this structure of Maya texts is what has confused modern minds, given our penchant for literal, straightforward reading. Even if the Monument 6 inscription refers to a god coming down at the end of Bak'tun 13, it isn't a statement about the end of the world, he said. ""They are writing in a more poetic sense, saying, Well, on the 21st of December 2012, the god is going to come down and start a new cycle and the old world is going to die and the new world is going to be reborn--just to make it more poetic."" Saturno, the Boston University archaeologist, agreed that the reference to a specific date is clear in Monument 6, but added that ""there's no text that follows and says, Herein will be the end of the world, and the world will end in fire. ... That's not anywhere in the text."" Rather, Saturno said, the hype around 2012 stems from dissatisfied Westerners looking to the ancients for guidance, hoping that peoples such as the Maya knew something then that could help us through difficult times now. In any case, even if the ancient inscriptions explicitly predicted the end of the world, Saturno wouldn't be worried, given the Maya track record with long-range prophecy. ""They didn't see [their] collapse coming. They didn't see the Spanish conquest coming.""

Written references to the end of Bak'tun 13 are few. In fact, most Maya scholars cite only one: a stone tablet on Monument 6 at the Tortuguero archaeological site in Mexico's Tabasco state. (Take a Maya quiz.) What exactly the tablet says, though, is a mystery, because the glyphs in question are partially damaged. Nevertheless, scholars have taken several stabs at translations, the most prominent in 1996 by Brown University's Stephen Houston and the University of Texas at Austin's David Stuart. Houston and Stuart's initial interpretation indicated that a god will descend at the end of Bak'tun 13. What would happen next is uncertain, although the scholars suggested this might have been a prophecy of some sort. This 1996 analysis was picked up ""on many New Age websites, associated forum discussions, and even a few book chapters"" as evidence that the Maya calendar had predicted the end of the world, according to Stuart. Houston and Stuart, however, independently revisited the glyphs recently and concluded that the inscription may actually contain no prophetic statements about 2012 at all. Rather, the mention of the end of Bak'tun 13 is likely a forward-looking statement that refers back to the main subject of the inscription, which is the dedication of Monument 6. In an October blog post about his conclusions, Stuart makes an analogy to a scribe wanting to immortalize the New York Yankees' 1950 sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies in that year's World Series. If this writer were to use the Maya rhetorical device thought to be in Monument 6's inscription, the text might read: ""On October 7, 1950, the New York Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies to win the World Series. It happened 29 years after the first Yankees victory in the World Series in 1921. And so 50 years before the year 2000 will occur, the Yankees won the World Series.""

He was kept to 68 games due to a left knee injury, sustained on December 27, 2006, against the New York Islanders, forcing him to sit out four weeks. In the playoffs, he helped the Senators to the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, where they fell short to the Anaheim Ducks in five games. Fisher posted career playoff highs with 5 goals, 5 assists and 10 points in 20 games. With one year left on his contract heading into the 2007-08 season, Mike re-signed with the Senators to a five-year, $21 million contract extension. He went on to set a career-high 23 goals that season, but he was forced to miss the playoffs, injuring his left knee in a knee-on-knee hit from Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mark Bell in the final game of the regular season. A month and a half into the 2008-09 season, Mike suffered from another knee injury, straining a ligament in his right knee against the New York Islanders on November 17, 2008. Nashville Predators (2011-2017)[] On February 10, 2011, Mike was traded to the Nashville Predators in exchange for the Predators' 2011 first round draft pick (Stefan Noesen) and a conditional pick in 2012. The condition was that should the Predators were to win a playoff series, the Senators would receive a third-round pick and a second round pick if the Predators won two or more playoff series. The Predators won their first round playoff, but they ultimately lost their second round series, meaning the Senators received a third-round pick. According to Mike, although there were many trade deals for him, Ottawa GM Bryan Murray and Ottawa owner Eugene Melnyk had chosen to accept Nashville's offer so that he could be closer to his wife, Carrie Underwood. On February 12, 2011, Mike played his first game with the Predators on February 12, 2011, and scored an assist in a 5-3 win over the Colorado Avalanche. He scored his first goal as a Predator five days later, on February 17, against the Vancouver Canucks. He was the winner of the 2012 NHL

57,who plays stephanie plum in one for the money?,Kal Penn,Katherine Heigl,"One for the Money is a 2012 American crime comedy film based on Janet Evanovich's 1994 novel of the same name. Directed by Julie Anne Robinson, the screenplay was written by Liz Brixius, Karen McCullah Lutz, and Kirsten Smith. It stars Katherine Heigl, Jason O'Mara, Debbie Reynolds, John Leguizamo, Daniel Sunjata and Sherri Shepherd. The story revolves around Stephanie Plum, a broke and unemployed woman becoming a bail enforcement agent, going after a former high school crush who both skipped out on his payments and is a murder suspect. The film was in development hell after Columbia and TriStar Pictures had purchased the novel's adaptation rights in 1997. In April 2010, Lionsgate acquired the distribution rights. Produced by Lakeshore and Sidney Kimmel Entertainment, principal photography took place in the Ambridge borough in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. This film was the last theatrical appearance of Debbie Reynolds before her death on December 28, 2016. One for the Money was theatrically released in the United States on January 27, 2012 and was both a critical and commercial failure. The film was panned by critics, with many criticizing the script and Heigl's performance, and grossed just $38.1 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. == Plot == In the Chambersburg neighborhood of Trenton, New Jersey, Stephanie Plum is divorced and unemployed. Seeking a job at her cousin Vinnie's bail bonds business, she blackmails him into letting her become a bail enforcement agent and tracks down fugitive Joe Morelli, her high school ex-boyfriend who has skipped his $500,000 bail. Morelli escapes the inexperienced Stephanie, who turns to veteran bounty hunter Ricardo ""Ranger"" Manoso for help. Explaining that Morelli, a vice detective, is wanted for the murder of heroin dealer Ziggy Kulesza, Ranger buys Stephanie a gun. Police officer Eddie Gazarra, Stephanie's friend, informs her that Morelli shot Ziggy at the apartment of prostitute Carmen Sanchez. Morelli claimed to

the Burg, only a few streets away from their childhood home. After graduation, Stephanie married Dickie Orr, then promptly divorced him after discovering him in their new home, cheating on her with rival Joyce Barnhardt on their brand new dining room table. At the beginning of the first book, One for the Money, Stephanie has been laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer, she is being forced to sell off her appliances one by one in order to pay her rent, and her car is repossessed. This last straw prompts her to turn to her cousin Vinnie, owner of Vincent Plum Bail Bonds, for a job. She originally hopes to find a file clerk job at the Bail Bonds office but the position was taken, and the only position available is as an apprehension agent or bounty hunter. Vinnie refuses to hire her, but she manages to convince him to give her a shot by threatening to blackmail him. Stephanie's financial situation is still rather perilous, partially due to her poor financial skills, and she often finds herself seeking alternative ways to earn money in order to pay her bills. When the series begins, Stephanie Plum is single and living with her hamster, Rex, in an apartment building with predominantly elderly neighbors. She regularly visits her parents who live several miles away in the Burg for meals, ""family time,"" and pineapple upside-down cake. While Stephanie finds her family stressful, they often give her tips or connections which assist in her job. == Appearance == Stephanie Plum briefly describes herself in the first chapter of each book, typically mentioning her Italian-Hungarian descent, fast metabolism, with light skin, naturally curly brown hair (that she keeps shoulder-length), and blue eyes, and is 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) tall, and roughly 130 pounds (59 kg).

Let's Rush To Judgment!: Katherine Heigl As Stephanie Plum In 'One For The Money'Katherine Heigl will be playing the lead in the first film to come from a super-popular series of detective novels. Can she pull off dark hair and a Jersey accent? Let's Rush To Judgment!: Katherine Heigl As Stephanie Plum In 'One For The Money' Either this name means something to you, or it doesn't. Evanovich is the author of a series of books about bail bondswoman Stephanie Plum, who's now appeared all the way from One For The Money to the soon-to-be-released Explosive Eighteen. That's right: 18 books about Stephanie, her mother, her grandmother, her friends, and her endless -- and I do mean endless -- love triangle with cop Joe Morelli and the mysterious Ranger. (It makes ... somewhat more sense in the books. Not a lot more.) My history with these books is that I once devoured about six of them during a single one-week vacation, which speaks to their easy digestibility and addictiveness. I continued to read them through about the eighth or ninth book, at which point I realized Stephanie was never going to figure out her personal life or progress in a satisfying way, and I stopped reading them. They're fun, and I still recommend them for people who've never read them and like kicky detective stories, but I decided at some point that I didn't need ... you know, eighteen of them. Now comes Katherine Heigl, favored punching bag of any number of pop-culture media outlets, who has landed the role of Stephanie in this first film in what one assumes is a hoped-for franchise. Her Jersey accent seems to come and go, but basically, I roughly buy her as Stephanie, based on the trailer. Sherri Shepherd is, I must say, exactly my image of her friend Lula. Jason O'Mara is ... not Italian? And I always thought Morelli was? But their dynamic seems about right. Daniel Sunjata is slightly too merry and not mysterious enough for my vision of Ranger, but admittedly ... it is a trailer. Sponsor Message

Stephanie Plum is a fictional character and the protagonist in a series of novels written by Janet Evanovich. She is a spunky combination of Nancy Drew and Dirty Harry, and—although a female bounty hunter—is the opposite of Domino Harvey. She is described by the author as ""incredibly average and yet heroic if necessary"". Evanovich claims the inspiration for Stephanie's character came after watching Midnight Run starring Charles Grodin and Robert De Niro, adding, ""If Mickey Spillane wrote Archie and Veronica, Stephanie would be Betty."" As the series has progressed, Stephanie has become more stable and responsible, and a better bounty hunter. ""But truthfully,"" Evanovich says, ""Stephanie has stayed the same more than she's changed."" As of 2021, Stephanie has appeared in 28 full-length novels, four holiday novellas, and a short story in a compilation of various authors' works.

Evanovich says, ""I wouldn't go so far as to say Stephanie is an autobiographical character, but I will admit to knowing where she lives."" Like Evanovich, Stephanie originates from New Jersey, although Janet hails from South River and Stephanie was born in Trenton, New Jersey, the city where the series is set. Stephanie grew up in the Chambersburg neighborhood known to locals as ""the Burg"", and—like Evanovich—attended Douglass College, although Stephanie graduated ""without distinction"". The Burg is often portrayed in the series as a close-knit community, from which people rarely leave. Stephanie often finds former classmates and neighbors still living in the Burg, only a few streets away from their childhood home.

Theories have persisted despite Obama's pre-election release of his official Hawaiian birth certificate in 2008, confirmation by the Hawaii Department of Health based on the original documents, the April 2011 release of a certified copy of Obama's original Certificate of Live Birth (or long-form birth certificate), and contemporaneous birth announcements published in Hawaii newspapers. Polls conducted in 2010 (before the April 2011 release) suggested that at least 25% of adult Americans said that they doubted Obama's U.S. birth, and a May 2011 Gallup poll found that the percentage had fallen to 13% of American adults (23% of Republicans). The fall was attributed to Obama's release of the long form in April 2011. == Background == === Early life of Barack Obama === People who express doubts about Obama's eligibility or reject details about his early life are often informally called ""birthers"", a term that parallels the nickname ""truthers"" for adherents of 9/11 conspiracy theories. These conspiracy theorists reject at least some of the following facts about his early life: Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961 at the Kapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Ann Dunham, from Wichita, Kansas, and her husband Barack Obama Sr., a Luo from Nyang'oma Kogelo, Nyanza Province (in what was then the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya), who was attending the University of Hawaii. Birth notices for Barack Obama were published in The Honolulu Advertiser on August 13 and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on August 14, 1961. Obama's father's immigration file also clearly states Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. One of his high school teachers, who was acquainted with his mother at the time, remembered hearing about the day of his birth. Obama's parents were divorced in 1964. He attended kindergarten in 1966–1967 at Noelani Elementary School in Honolulu. In

Barack H. Obama is the 44th President of the United States. His story is the American story -- values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others. With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank. After working his way through college with the help of scholarships and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of local steel plants. He went on to attend law school, where he became the first African--American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community. President Obama's years of public service are based around his unwavering belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years, cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending online. He was

Barack Hussein Obama II (born August 4, 1961) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American president in U.S. history. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. In 1996, Obama was elected to represent the 13th district in the Illinois Senate, a position he held until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In the 2008 presidential election, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate and defeated Republican nominee John McCain. Obama was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, a decision that drew both criticism and praise. During his first term, his administration responded to the 2007–2008 financial crisis with measures including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a major stimulus package to guide the economy in recovering from the Great Recession; a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts; legislation to reform health care; and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a major financial regulation reform bill. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He oversaw the end of the Iraq War; and ordered Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, who

Barack Obama: Life Before the Presidency Barack Obama: Life Before the Presidency Breadcrumb Barack Obama: Life Before the Presidency Barack Hussein Obama II was born on August 4, 1961, in Hawaii. His parents, who met as students at the University of Hawaii, were Ann Dunham, a white American from Kansas, and Barack Obama Sr., a black Kenyan studying in the United States. Obama's father left the family when Obama was two and, after further studies at Harvard University, returned to Kenya, where he died in an automobile accident nineteen years later. After his parents divorced, Obama's mother married another foreign student at the University of Hawaii, Lolo Soetoro of Indonesia. From age six through ten, Obama lived with his mother and stepfather in Indonesia, where he attended Catholic and Muslim schools. ""I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child,"" Obama later recalled. ""And so what I benefited from is a multiplicity of cultures that all fed me."" Concerned for his education, Obama's mother sent him back to Hawaii to live with her parents, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham, and to attend Hawaii's prestigious Punahou School from fifth grade through graduation from high school. While Obama was in school, his mother divorced Soetoro, returned to Hawaii to study cultural anthropology at the university, and then went back to Indonesia to do field research. Living with his grandparents, Obama was a good but not outstanding student at Punahou. He played varsity basketball and, as he later admitted, ""dabbled in drugs and alcohol,"" including marijuana and cocaine. As for religion, Obama later wrote, because his parents and grandparents were nonbelievers, ""I was not raised in a religious household."" Obama's mother, who ""to the end of her life [in 1995] would proudly proclaim herself an unreconstructed liberal,"" deeply admired the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and taught her son, he later wrote, that ""To be black

""Shannon wasn't on a binge or anything like that,"" Stevens said in a telephone interview from New York. ""I had seen him at times throughout our history worse off. ""He had been generally healthy for a long time - he was in rehab that summer and he was staying clean on the road."" Speculation abounded that Hoon might have been pushed into touring before he was physically and emotionally ready, but Stevens argues that he was more settled and less vulnerable to temptation on the road than he was at home. ""He wanted to go on tour and he felt like he was ready,"" Stevens said. ""This was not a pressure situation. ... I think that Shannon was healthier when he was out playing and singing every night and getting his emotions out on stage."" And he insists that Hoon ""was crazy from the day I met him,"" that fame had nothing to do with his downfall. He would veer from pulling practical jokes to displaying what Stevens called ""completely irrational behavior."" ""He wasn't doing it with a safety net and he wasn't overly cautious,"" Stevens said. ""He was proceeding with this sort of abandon that you did your best to try to curb."" Stevens says the band forced Hoon into rehab twice and kept all mind-altering substances out of the band's circle. ""There (were) so many times I can't even tell you, that in the middle of the night, I'm grabbing Shannon by the ears and telling him, 'You're going to kill yourself and you're going to ruin everyone's life around you,""' Stevens said. ""There's a lot of people that you would just write off in that situation, but he was so amazing and he made up for it in so many other ways that you wanted to stay with him."" In a last-ditch effort, the band hired a counselor to keep an eye on Hoon during the ""Soup"" tour. But the singer hated the scrutiny and the other four found it equally awkward, so the counselor was let go. Hoon died shortly thereafter. ""We really felt that Shannon

Blind Melon Band Is No More, Members Recall Hoon As 'Tyrant And Angel' Plenty has been written about the tragic death of Blind Melon's Shannon Hoon, who died from a cocaine overdose in October 1995 at the age of 28. But stories have been comparatively few about Hoon the man, not the addict, and the people he left behind. After a year, the four surviving members of Blind Melon are now speaking about the friend they remember as ""a tyrant and an angel"" - the erratic, explosive, creative, compassionate, manipulative personality Shannon Hoon was from day to day. They've released ""Nico,"" a collection of the last remaining musical vestiges of Blind Melon, in Hoon's memory. It's named for his infant daughter, Nico Blue. ""Nico"" buries the name and the entity Blind Melon along with Hoon; the four remaining members are deciding on a new singer and a new name and have decided not to play Hoon's songs again. Hoon died eight weeks after the release of Blind Melon's second album, ""Soup,"" when Nico was 13 weeks old. The band was to have played a gig in New Orleans that night. Hoon had been arrested for drunken and disorderly conduct during the recording of the album. The band's eponymous debut album went triple platinum and produced the Top 10 hit ""No Rain."" They played Woodstock 1994 and were nominated for a Grammy and American Music Award. In September 1995, Hoon was upbeat and optimistic. He was awe-struck at the birth of his daughter and vowed to be a good father. ""Having a child can make you re-evaluate how you need to be there,"" Hoon said then. ""I need to start caring about myself if I'm going to be the proper father. ""This is all fun and youth-prolonging,"" he said of his career, ""but I want to be a father, and it's hard to be when you're away."" Guitarist Rogers Stevens says Hoon's death was an accident, that he fully expected to wake up as usual the next morning. ""Shannon wasn't on a binge or anything like that,"" Stevens said in a telephone interview from New York. ""I had

""We really felt that Shannon was doing things to spite this guy, to get to him, to make him try to leave,"" Stevens said. ""It just seemed like it was counterproductive. I (felt) that Shannon was going to get malicious towards this guy and we didn't think it was right."" Hoon's last lyrics are filled with self-examination and self-criticism. And looking back on them, the irony and foreshadowing is overwhelming. Hoon is basically chronicling and almost anticipating what is about to happen to him. He knows, as he says in ""Hell,"" that there's no way his body can keep up with his mind. He covers ""The Pusher,"" written by Hoyt Axton and made famous by Steppenwolf, and changes the lyrics so that they criticize pushers of religion rather than pushers of drugs. In retrospect, the first song the band wrote together, ""Soul One,"" could have been written for Nico. Hoon sings about finding someone who really means something to him and regrets that ""I never got the chance to say good-bye."" Even though proceeds from ""Nico"" are going to the Musician's Assistance Program, which gets free help for musicians having trouble with drugs and alcohol, Stevens says he won't become an anti-drug crusader. ""I think that our situation is an example, and what happened to Shannon is an example, and someone should be able to look at this and get it,"" he said. ""I really believe that it's wrong to try to think for other people, and I think people are best served when they're just given the information and (can) figure it out for themselves.""

Review: Blind Melon's late lead singer Shannon Hoon tells his story in new documentary The curse of self-awareness is sown throughout the documentary ""All I Can Say,"" a kaleidoscopic video diary recorded by Blind Melon singer Shannon Hoon from his arrival in Los Angeles in 1990 to the hours prior to his fatal 1995 cocaine overdose in New Orleans. Hoon, a Lafayette, Ind., native, obsessively recorded everything, from the mundanity of empty hotel rooms, answering-machine messages and brushing his teeth to more significant events, including Blind Melon signing a large 1991 recording contract atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood and the birth of his daughter just months before his death. The camera was his companion, confessional, surveillance tool, and sometimes even a weapon of passive aggression. It also served as a means of absorbing the onslaught of experiences as he went from aspiring musician to international rock star. Advertisement At one point, he explains to an unseen interviewer who asks whether there is time to reflect, ""That's why I've got a video camera. There's so much happening right now I can't really sit back and soak it all in. I'll just watch it later. Little pieces of time I'll never get back."" The videos are raw and revealing. Hoon could be charming, playful and intelligent. His reverence for Neil Young, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones is endearing. He was a fanboy. He could also be a jerk. He didn't always treat Lisa Crouse, his longtime girlfriend (and mother-to-be of his child), or his bandmates well. He had numerous encounters with the law including an arrest for indecent exposure after he disrobed onstage and urinated on a fan at a show in Vancouver. But he is never less than passionate about making music or performing. Advertisement The attendant fame appears to be the price Hoon felt he had to endure in order to write and perform his songs. But the video camera allowed him to shape his view of the world. He likely did not

Cannabis causes thirst [23] and may have been driving water intake despite the putative presence of hyponatraemia that we hypothesize. Hyponatraemia has also been linked to cocaine, although reports are uncommon [24]. However, there is no publicly available evidence of cocaine use on the day of his death. Alcohol. Alcohol use has been linked to an increased risk of hyponatraemia. There are reports of increased alcohol intake in the last months of Lee's life: 'would drink ten to twenty ceramic bottles of sake in an evening.' 'Near the end,' Lowe added, 'Bruce was often very tired and dizzy' [4]; his friends say he was drinking alcohol more frequently [3]. Low dietary solute intake. The association of excess alcohol intake with hyponatraemia is in part related to a low dietary solute intake. There is evidence that indeed in his last months, Lee's solute intake was low while water intake was high. An abnormal dietary pattern had been observed by physicians. Bleecker states that 'Dr Au's advised Bruce to begin eating a balanced and proper diet' and 'According to Linda, during her husband's final months, he had stopped eating solid food and was existing miserably on carrot and apple juice' [4]. This dietary pattern of mostly fluid may have explained the weight loss that appears to have accelerated between May and July 1973. In textbooks, this low solute diet has been labelled as a 'tea and toast diet' (Table 3). Table 3. Major causes of hypotonic hyponatraemia [21]. Those that may have applied to Lee, according to publicly available information, are underlined. Bleecker states that Lee complained to Dr. Harold L.

Updated: Sep 09, 2022 3:39 PM EDT Aaron Davidson/Getty Images (1947-) Who Is Paula's Dean? From Paula's Home Cooking to Top Chef, Paula Deen was a fixture on the Food Network for more than a decade. She has also written several books on Southern cooking, as well as a memoir, and has started her own magazine, Cooking with Paula Deen. Following a racially charged controversy that led to her departure from the Food Network, she returned to TV hosting in 2016 with Positively Paula. Early Life Born on January 19, 1947, in Albany, Georgia, Paula Deen went to Albany High School and married her first husband after graduating in 1965. Her parents both died by the time she was 23, a loss that led Deen into panic attacks and chronic agoraphobia. She retreated into her cooking, eventually starting a home-based catering business, The Bag Lady, with her two sons serving as deliverymen. The Bag Lady was a hit, and its popularity forced Deen to expand beyond the confines of her kitchen. In January 1996, she opened her own restaurant, The Lady and Sons, in downtown Savannah, which she ran with her two sons. By 1999, USA Today had awarded The Lady and Sons its ""International Meal of the Year"" title. The restaurant, like Deen's catering company, was also wildly popular, and her first cookbook, The Lady and Sons Savannah Country Cookbook, soon followed; the book gave readers a chance to try Deen's recipes at home and, in turn, led to her first TV appearance, on the QVC shopping channel. TV Stardom After a few guest appearances on Food Network shows, Deen shot a pilot in early 2001 for the network, called Afternoon Tea. The network gave the show a thumbs-up, and Deen landed her own show in 2002, Paula's Home Cooking. With the success of that series, the Food Network debuted Paula's Party in 2006. Her sons, Bobby and Jamie, began making

Paula Deen Paula Deen is a Savannah-based restaurateur, author, and television personality. Her cooking and businesses have won both praise and criticism, especially after her past use of racial slurs and promotion of high-sugar recipes while being diabetic became known. Paula Ann Hiers was born in Albany on January 19, 1947, to Corrie and Earl Hiers. She spent her early childhood at River Bend, a small resort in Dougherty County owned by her grandparents. Her father worked at a car dealership, and her mother and grandmother ran the restaurant at River Bend. Although the young Paula often wanted to help in the kitchen, her mother found the child's presence disruptive due to Paula's need to ""be in control of [the] pots."" She graduated from Albany High School in 1965 and at age eighteen married Jimmy Deen, whom she met in high school. Her first son, Jamie, was born in 1967, followed three years later by another son, Bobby. Paula DeenPhotograph from Paula Deen Soon after the birth of her second son, Deen began to suffer from depression and fear of public places, and she often used cooking as a way to cope with her illness. In 1989 she and her husband divorced, and she moved with her sons to Savannah. There she opened a catering business called The Bag Lady, where Deen and her sons distributed bagged sandwiches and desserts in downtown Savannah. When this proved a successful venture, she chose to open a restaurant. In 1990 Deen's first restaurant, The Lady, opened in a Best Western hotel in Savannah. In 1996 she opened a larger restaurant, The Lady and Sons, after the lease for The Lady's space expired. The restaurant proved successful, serving southern favorites like hoecakes, fried chicken, and fried green tomatoes. The following year she published her first cookbook and sold it on QVC, a home-shopping television network. While becoming well known outside the Southeast through her cookbook, her restaurant benefited from increased Savannah tourism resulting from John

Paula Deen (born January 19, 1947, Albany, Georgia, U.S.) is an American chef who popularized the cuisine of the American South through restaurants, cookbooks, and television programs. Aside from her culinary creations, her appeal lay largely in her rags-to-riches story, her distinctive Southern accent, and her warm and welcoming public persona. Deen grew up in southwestern Georgia, not far from the site where her ancestors had operated a cotton plantation in the mid-19th century. She spent her early childhood at a small resort owned by her maternal grandparents, but she left at age six, when her parents purchased a gas station and souvenir shop in Albany and the family moved into the back of the shop. Deen remained close to her grandparents, however, and it was from her grandmother that she learned the style of cooking that would eventually make her famous. Shortly after Deen graduated from Albany High School in 1965, she married her high-school sweetheart, Jimmy Deen (divorced 1989). Her father died in 1966 and her mother four years later. In addition to the challenge of raising two young boys, cumulative adversity--including being robbed at gunpoint while working as a bank teller--were overwhelming for Deen, and she became psychologically unstable, experiencing frequent panic attacks and increasingly debilitating bouts of agoraphobia. After moving to Savannah in 1987, she recovered enough to secure a job in a hospital. To supplement her meagre income, in 1989 she launched The Bag Lady, a side business making ""lunch and love in a bag"" for her colleagues at the hospital. Deen's lunch business expanded, and by 1991 she had opened a sit-down restaurant at a Savannah hotel. The restaurant, called The Lady, flourished, and in 1996 she moved it to a larger space. The restaurant reopened as The Lady & Sons, marking the integral role that Deen's two boys played in the operation.

Some of Deen's fans expressed their outrage over Deen's firing, leaving messages on the Food Network's Facebook page and threatening to boycott the channel. Despite these protests, the Food Network stood by its decision to end its relationship with Deen after 11 years. Later that month, Deen was dropped by her publisher, Ballantine Books. The publishing company, which is a division of Random House, decided to cancel her upcoming cookbook Paula Deen's New Testament. Rebuilding Her Career After being dropped by her network and publisher, Deen sought to regain her celebrity chef status. She reached out directly to her fans through her tour with Paula Dean Live!, an event featuring cooking demonstrations. In June 2014, Dean also announced plans to start her own network online. The Paula Deen Network launched in September 2014 with such original shows as 20-Minute Meals and Paula Cooking Light. Continuing her comeback, Deen in 2015 competed on Dancing with the Stars. In late 2016, she began hosting Positively Paula, a family-friendly cooking show taped from her home in Savannah, Georgia.

About Paula As a young girl growing up in Albany, Georgia, Paula Deen never dreamed she would become an American icon. As a young mother, Paula was living the American dream--married to her high school sweetheart, raising two adorable boys--when tragedy struck. Her parents died, her marriage failed, and she began a prolonged battle with agoraphobia. With her boys in their teens and her family near homelessness, Paula took her last $200, reached deep inside her soul, and started The Bag Lady, a home-based catering company that marked the start of Deen's professional cooking career. With sons Jamie and Bobby delivering ""lunch-and-love-in-a-bag,"" beginning in June 1989, Paula turned around her life by sharing what she knew best--traditional Southern cooking. Overcoming poverty, self-doubt, and health challenges to achieve success and acclaim, Paula has become one of the best-known personalities in the world of cooking. Yet the most remarkable part of Paula Deen's journey from her kitchen to fame is that Paula has remained every bit as genuine, real, and full of love as she was the day the first meals left her kitchen. Deen's first business, The Bag Lady, brought out Paula's strengths and stabilized her family. She moved her catering company to a small restaurant at a Best Western motel in Savannah and finally opened her first restaurant, The Lady and Sons, with Bobby and Jamie five years later. The restaurant was a hit, and the popularity of Paula and her cooking led to her first cookbook, 1998's The Lady and Sons Savannah Country Cookbook. This gave her fans the opportunity to try Paula's recipes at home and led to her first television appearance on QVC. Paula's genuine warmth and folksy personality made her a natural for television. In 1999, USA Today food critic Jerry Shriver named The Lady and Sons ""International Meal of the Year."" Since then, Paula's business interests have grown considerably. In 2011, Paula Deen Foods was launched and in 2013, they introduced",1,1,5,1

The First World Series As Major League Baseball is about to embark on their annual World Series, many sports fans may not realize that the first use of the term ""World Series"" was in reference not to baseball but to professional football. In 1902, the manager of Madison Square Garden, a New York promoter named Tom O'Rourke, was looking for a way to fill his arena on New Year's Day, 1903. He came up with the idea of playing a series of indoor football games, the winner of which, he declared, would be the world champion. O'Rourke promoted his tournament, which kicked off on Dec. 28, 1902, as pro football's ""World Series."" Thus, strictly speaking, America's first ""World Series"" was actually a pro football game. Ten months later, on Oct. 1, 1903, MLB played its first modern World Series game. Major League Baseball's first World Series game occurred on Oct. 1, 1903 when the Boston Pilgrims defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-3 in Boston, Mass. The game occured ten months after pro football's ""World Series."" The best pro football teams in 1902 had been the Phillies and Athletics of Philadelphia, the Stars of Pittsburgh, and the Red and Blacks of Watertown, New York. Unfortunately, O'Rourke was unable to get any of those teams to participate in his hastily scheduled tournament. However, players from both the Phillies and Athletics got together and formed their own team that became known as the ""New York"" team. The other teams accepting O'Rourke's invitation included the Orange, New Jersey Athletic Club; the Warlow Athletic Club; the New York Knickerbockers; and the Syracuse Athletic Club.

The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the ""Fall Classic"", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States. A total of 120 World Series have been contested through 2024, with the AL champion winning 68 and the NL champion winning 52. The New York Yankees of the AL have played in 41 World Series, winning 27 – the most championship appearances and most victories by any MLB team. The Dodgers and the Yankees are tied for the most losses with 14 each. The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 championships, the most among NL clubs and second-most all-time behind the Yankees. The Dodgers have represented the NL the most in the World Series with 22 appearances. The Seattle Mariners are the only MLB franchise that has never appeared in a World Series; the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay

by fire marshals now."" That World Series was a first-of-its-kind experiment concocted by the Pirates, who were 1903 champions of the National League, and the rival-league champion Americans. There would be no World Series in 1904 because the New York Giants refused to participate for fear of having to face their newfound rivals, the New York Highlanders (to be known later as the Yankees), who in the final days of the season were overtaken by Boston for the American League championship. ""The owner of the Highlanders, not thinking his team would be a contender, rented his stadium to Fordham University for a football game -- so some games that should have been in New York were played in Boston, giving the Americans the home field advantage,"" Johnson says. ""New York lost on a bad business judgment."" The World Series was renewed in 1905 as an annual event that would come to be known as the ""Fall Classic."" Johnson argues that the Americans (Red Sox) should be credited as champions of 1904 based on the Giants' forfeit. ""They were the uncrowned champions,"" says Johnson, who adds that he may someday petition Major League Baseball to recognize Boston as the 1904 World Series champion. The 1903 World Series was a best-of-nine-games event. The Pirates won two of the first three games in Boston, including the opener, a 7-3 victory that featured the first World Series home run (an inside-the-park hit by Pittsburgh outfielder Jimmy Sebring). A Game 4 win at home gave the Pirates a 3-1 series advantage. But they were undone by a lack of pitching (one of their starters had experienced paranoid delusions and entered what was known as an ""insane asylum,"" where he would spend the rest of his life; another developed a sore arm while trapshooting) and a leg injury to their legendary shortstop Honus Wagner, whose baseball card sold recently for $7.25 million. ""I was too bum,"" acknowledged Wagner, who committed six errors and batted .222 for the series. ""What does it profit a man to

The first World Series was held at Northeastern 120 years ago Share On grounds now occupied by Cabot Physical Education Center, the Boston Americans beat the Pittsburgh Pirates in eight games to win the inaugural 1903 World Series. Photo by Northeastern University Library, Archives and Special Collections The 120th World Series between the Texas Rangers and Arizona Diamondbacks features some of baseball's biggest stars -- Corey Seager, Corbin Carroll, Ketel Marte and Marcus Semien, just to name a few. It's an annual baseball celebration with historic ties to Northeastern. Did you know that the first World Series was held more than a century ago on the grounds of the university's Boston campus? On Oct. 1, 1903, a crowd of more than 16,000 watched the visiting Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Boston Americans 5-3 in Game 1 of the inaugural World Series. It was held on a site now occupied largely by Northeastern's Cabot Physical Education Center, and there was no anticipation for the grand spectacle that the World Series would become. The Huntington Avenue American League Baseball Grounds were demolished in 1912, clearing the way for Northeastern to develop the property over the ensuing decades. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University The upstart Boston team -- to be renamed the Red Sox five years later -- won the final four games to win the initial showdown between the National and American leagues. The champs were led by 36-year-old Cy Young, the best (and oldest) pitcher of that pioneering era. Young, who would retire with 511 wins -- a record unlikely to be broken -- didn't use a mitt until his seventh Major League season. ""They had to enlist Cy Young and a couple of other players to help the ground staff tear tickets at the World Series,"" says author and historian Richard A. Johnson, longtime curator of The Sports Museum of New England. ""He wouldn't do it for a game he was starting, but he was there, tearing tickets at the turnstiles. You can imagine coming

1903 WORLD SERIES In an effort to end a bitter two year rivalry and promote unity in baseball, the veteran National League and newly established American League decided to bury the hatchet and come together for a new kind of season finale. Nine years earlier, the two top teams in the National League competed in an experimental post-season championship in which Boston beat Pittsburgh five games to three. In 1903, both teams (now in separate leagues) found themselves competing against one another in the first official ""World Series"". Echoing the 1894 proposal of owner William C. Temple, Pittsburgh's Barney Dreyfuss and Boston's Henry Killilea agreed that their ballclubs, who were both pennant winners, should meet in a best-of-nine playoff series for the ""World Championship."" The spectacle would represent the first step towards a mutual reconciliation for years of open hostilities and blatant player raids. The Pirates, who had just won their third consecutive pennant, were the perfect representatives for the veteran Nationals. Their rivals, the Americans, had won their flag by 14 1/2 games and represented the fledgling Americans who were still trying to establish themselves as a worthy competitor. Game 1 of the series proved to be a complete success as fans were treated to the best baseball that both leagues had to offer. The Pirates played exceptionally well on both sides of the ball as Deacon Phillippe pitched a six hitter and right fielder Jimmy Sebring hit the first home run in World Series history. He alone drove in four runs for a 7-3 victory. Game 2 did not disappoint either as Boston mirrored Pittsburgh's previous performance. They evened the series when Bill Dinneen threw a three-hitter and Patsy Dougherty walloped two homers in a 3-0 triumph. Pittsburgh's pitching staff, ravaged by illness and injuries, forced the Pirates to start Phillippe again in Game 3 after only one day of rest.

Issued by the Central Bank of Malaysia, it is divided into 100 cents (Malay: sen). == Etymology == The word ringgit is an obsolete term for ""jagged"" in the Malay language. The word was originally used to refer to serrated edges. The first European coins to circulate widely in the region were Spanish ""pieces of eight"" or ""cob"", their crude appearance resembling stones, hence the word jagged. The availability and circulation of this Spanish currency were due to the Spanish controlling nearby Philippines. An early printed source, the Dictionary of the Malayan Language from 1812 had already referred to the ringgit as a unit of money. In modern usage, ringgit is used almost solely for the currency. Due to the common heritage of the three modern currencies, the Singapore dollar and the Brunei dollar are also called ringgit in Malay (currencies such as the US and Australian dollars are translated as dolar), although nowadays the Singapore dollar is more commonly called dolar in Malay. To differentiate between the three currencies, the Malaysian currency is referred to as Ringgit Malaysia, hence the official abbreviation and currency symbol RM. Internationally, the ISO 4217 currency code for Malaysian ringgit is MYR. The Malay names ringgit and sen were officially adopted as the sole official names on 28 August 1975. Previously they had been known officially as dollars and cents in English and ringgit and sen in Malay, and in some parts of the country this usage continues. In the northern states of Peninsular Malaysia, denominations of 10 sen are called kupang in Northern Malay and called pua̍t (鏺/鈸) in Penang Hokkien which is thought to be derived from the Thai word baht. e.g. 50 sen is lima kupang in Malay or 'samah' in the Kelantan dialect and gōo-pua̍t (五鏺/鈸) in Hokkien.

Malaysian Ringgit The Malaysian ringgit (symbol: RM; code: MYR) is the official currency of Malaysia, replacing the Malaysian dollar in 1967. It is subdivided into 100 sen and commonly found in denominations of RM1, RM5, RM10, RM20, RM50, RM100 bills and 5, 10, 20, 50 sen. The ringgit is issued by the Central Bank of Malaysia.

The Tamil speaking communities in Malaysia use veḷḷi (வெள்ளி) meaning ""silver"" in Tamil to refer to ringgit, while for sen, the word kācu (காசு) is used, from which the English word ""cash"" is derived. == History == === Before independence === The Spanish-American silver dollar brought over by the Manila galleons was the primary currency for international trade, used in Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries; it was eventually called the ringgit. The various dollars introduced in the 19th century were itself derived from the Spanish dollar: the Straits dollar, Sarawak dollar and the British North Borneo dollar. From these dollars were derived their successor currencies the Malayan dollar and the Malaya and British Borneo dollar, and eventually the modern-day Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar. === After independence (1967–1997) === On 12 June 1967, the Malaysian dollar, issued by the new central bank, Central Bank of Malaysia, replaced the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par. The new currency retained all denominations of its predecessor except the $10,000 denomination, and also brought over the colour schemes of the old dollar. Over the course of the following decades, minor changes were made to the notes and coins issued, from the introduction of the M$1 coin in 1967, to the demonetization of RM500 and RM1,000 notes in 1999. As the Malaysian dollar replaced the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par and Malaysia was a participating member of the sterling area, the new dollar was originally valued at 8+4⁄7 dollars per 1 British pound sterling; in turn, £1 = US$2.80 so that US$1 = M$3.06. In November 1967, five months after the introduction of the Malaysian dollar, the pound was devalued by 14.3% from US$2.80 to US$2.40, leading to a collapse in confidence for the

64,who do pagans worship?,Gods and goddesses.,Odin,"Paganism Introduction Paganism has its roots in the pre-Christian religions of Europe. Its re-emergence in Britain parallels that in other western countries, where it has been growing rapidly since the 1950s. The social infrastructure of paganism reflects the value the pagan community places on unity in diversity; it consists of a network of inter-related traditions and local groups served by several larger organisations. In Scotland the Pagan Federation acts as an educational and representative body. Pagans understand deity to be manifest within nature and recognise divinity as taking many forms, finding expression in goddesses as well as gods. Goddess worship is central in paganism. Pagans believe that nature is sacred and that the natural cycles of birth, growth and death observed in the world around us carry profoundly spiritual meanings. Human beings are seen as part of nature, along with other animals, trees, stones, plants and everything else that is of this earth. Most pagans believe in some form of reincarnation, viewing death as a transition within a continuing process of existence. Attitudes to healthcare staff and illness Most pagans have a positive attitude towards healthcare staff and are willing to seek medical help and advice when sick Religious practices Most pagans worship the old pre-Christian gods and goddesses through seasonal festivals and other ceremonies. Observance of these festivals is very important to pagans, and those in hospital will generally wish to celebrate them in some form. As there are many diverse traditions within paganism, you should ask individual patients if they have any special requirements. Some pagans may wish to have a small white candle or a small figure of a goddess on their locker. Diet For ethical reasons, most pagans strongly prefer foods derived from organic farming and free-range livestock rearing, while many are vegetarian or vegan. Fasting There are no organised fast days, but some pagans choose to fast in

strongly prefer foods derived from organic farming and free-range livestock rearing, while many are vegetarian or vegan. Fasting There are no organised fast days, but some pagans choose to fast in preparation for Ostara (spring equinox). Washing and toilet Washing and toilet present no unusual problems for pagans Ideas of modesty and dress There are no particular points to be noted in this area and few pagans would object to being examined by doctors of the opposite sex. Death customs Most pagans believe in some form of reincarnation, viewing death as a transition within a continuing process of existence. Pagans accept death as a natural part of life and will wish to know when they are dying so that they may consciously prepare for it. Individuals may ask for rituals (soon as possible after death) Birth customs As paganism celebrates life, birth is viewed as sacred and empowering. Pagan women will wish to make their own informed decisions regarding prenatal and neonatal care. Family planning Pagans will generally plan pregnancies, and use contraception as appropriate. Paganism emphasises women's control over their own bodies, and the weighty decisions relating to abortion are seen as a personal matter for the woman concerned, who will be supported in the choices she makes. Blood transfusions, transplants and organ donation Most pagans would have no objection to blood transfusions and may receive transplants or donate organs for transplant.

Paganism (from Latin pāgānus 'rural', 'rustic', later 'civilian') is a term first used in the fourth century by early Christians for people in the Roman Empire who practiced polytheism, or ethnic religions other than Judaism. In the time of the Roman Empire, individuals fell into the pagan class either because they were increasingly rural and provincial relative to the Christian population, or because they were not milites Christi (soldiers of Christ). Alternative terms used in Christian texts were hellene, gentile, and heathen. Ritual sacrifice was an integral part of ancient Greco-Roman religion and was regarded as an indication of whether a person was pagan or Christian. Paganism has broadly connoted the ""religion of the peasantry"". During and after the Middle Ages, the term paganism was applied to any non-Christian religion, and the term presumed a belief in ""false gods"". The origin of the application of the term ""pagan"" to polytheism is debated. In the 19th century, paganism was adopted as a self-descriptor by members of various artistic groups inspired by the ancient world. In the 20th century, it came to be applied as a self-descriptor by practitioners of modern paganism, modern pagan movements and Polytheistic reconstructionists. Modern pagan traditions often incorporate beliefs or practices, such as nature worship, that are different from those of the largest world religions. Contemporary knowledge of old pagan religions and beliefs comes from several sources, including anthropological field research records, the evidence of archaeological artifacts, and the historical accounts of ancient writers regarding cultures known to Classical antiquity. Most modern pagan religions existing today express a worldview that is pantheistic, panentheistic, polytheistic, or animistic, but some are monotheistic. == Nomenclature and etymology == === Pagan === It is crucial to stress right from the start that until the 20th century, people did not call themselves pagans to

animistic, but some are monotheistic. == Nomenclature and etymology == === Pagan === It is crucial to stress right from the start that until the 20th century, people did not call themselves pagans to describe the religion they practiced. The notion of paganism, as it is generally understood today, was created by the early Christian Church. It was a label that Christians applied to others, one of the antitheses that were central to the process of Christian self-definition. As such, throughout history it was generally used in a derogatory sense. The term pagan derives from Late Latin paganus, revived during the Renaissance. Itself deriving from classical Latin pagus which originally meant 'region delimited by markers', paganus had also come to mean 'of or relating to the countryside', 'country dweller', 'villager'; by extension, 'rustic', 'unlearned', 'yokel', 'bumpkin'; in Roman military jargon, 'non-combatant', 'civilian', 'unskilled soldier'. It is related to pangere ('to fasten', 'to fix or affix') and ultimately comes from Proto-Indo-European *pag- ('to fix' in the same sense): The adoption of paganus by the Latin Christians as an all-embracing, pejorative term for polytheists represents an unforeseen and singularly long-lasting victory, within a religious group, of a word of Latin slang originally devoid of religious meaning. The evolution occurred only in the Latin west, and in connection with the Latin church. Elsewhere, Hellene or gentile (ethnikos) remained the word for pagan; and paganos continued as a purely secular term, with overtones of the inferior and the commonplace. Medieval writers often assumed that paganus as a religious term was a result of the conversion patterns during the Christianization of Europe, where people in towns and cities were converted more easily than those in remote regions, where old ways tended to remain. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in

Modern paganism, also known as contemporary paganism and neopaganism, spans a range of new religious movements variously influenced by the beliefs of pre-modern peoples across Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. Despite some common similarities, contemporary pagan movements are diverse, sharing no single set of beliefs, practices, or religious texts. Scholars of religion may study the phenomenon as a movement divided into different religions, while others study neopaganism as a decentralized religion with an array of denominations. Adherents rely on pre-Christian, folkloric, and ethnographic sources to a variety of degrees; many of them follow a spirituality that they accept as entirely modern, while others claim to adhere to prehistoric beliefs, or else, they attempt to revive indigenous religions as accurately as possible. Modern pagan movements are frequently described on a spectrum ranging from reconstructive, which seeks to revive historical pagan religions; to eclectic movements, which blend elements from various religions and philosophies with historical paganism. Polytheism, animism, and pantheism are common features across pagan theology. Modern pagans can also include atheists, upholding virtues and principles associated with paganism while maintaining a secular worldview. Humanistic, naturalistic, or secular pagans may recognize deities as archetypes or useful metaphors for different cycles of life, or reframe magic as a purely psychological practice. Contemporary paganism has been associated with the New Age movement, with scholars highlighting their similarities as well as their differences. The academic field of pagan studies began to coalesce in the 1990s, emerging from disparate scholarship in the preceding two decades. == Terminology == === Definition === There is ""considerable disagreement as to the precise definition and the proper usage"" of the term modern paganism. Even within the academic field of pagan studies, there is no consensus about",1,1,3,1

In Madagascar, after Marty, Alex's best friend, leaves in an effort to take a train to the wild, Alex, Gloria the Hippopotamus (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (voiced by David Schwimmer) pursue him and are shot with tranquilizer darts by humans. The animal-rights activists pressure the zoo into releasing them back into the wild, but on the ship to the preserve, Alex and his friends fall into the ocean. They wash ashore on Madagascar, and, while Marty is excited to be free, Alex wishes to go home. He grows very hungry after days of being unable to eat, not realizing that steak is animal flesh. Hunger drives Alex into a crazed state, and after almost killing Marty in hunger, in a moment of lucidity, he goes into self-imposed exile, barricading himself in fossa territory. Marty pursues him, unwilling to leave his friend, but is attacked by the fossa, the native predators of Madagascar. Alex works to defend Marty and is later given sushi by the penguins to satiate his hunger. In Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Alex encounters his parents, Zuba and Florrie (Sherri Shepherd), who are overjoyed to see their son and he becomes co-alpha lion alongside his father. Zuba assumes Alex is strong after hearing he is the ""King"" of New York and arranges a rite of passage into the pride. Makunga (Alec Baldwin), Zuba's rival, persuades Alex to challenge Teetsi during the Alex's rite of passage. Teetsi was revealed to be a bulky, strong lion and Alex is quickly defeated by him. To keep from banishing Alex, Zuba transfers his control to Makunga, and in turn, he, Florrie, and Alex are banished. Zuba soon grows unaccepting of Alex after realizing he is not a fierce warrior. The next day, the watering hole is shown to be dried up and Alex leaves with Marty to find out the cause. They leave the safety of the reserve, prompting Zuba to follow Alex and bring him back.

This is a list of characters from the DreamWorks Animation franchise of Madagascar films and TV shows. == Concept and creation == Tom McGrath explained in an interview that the intention of Madagascar was not to take a political stance on whether ""zoos are bad and the wild is better, or that the wild is bad,"" but to show ""the most extreme 'fish out of water' story that (they) could do"". McGrath stated ""the basic irony to the story is that, you think animals do belong in the wild, but if they're so accustomed to civility, they wouldn't know where food even came from,"" and the animals were meant to ""love the zoo and to love where they are because they've got"" 5,000 square feet (460 m2) ""right off Fifth Avenue"". McGrath also described, during the research of Madagascar, they ""found these crazy, weird animals that were already cartoons in their own right."" == Primary == === Alex === Alex (born Alakay) is a male African lion. He's happy, go-lucky and is best friends with Marty (voiced by Chris Rock). He's the star attraction at zoo but learns to adapt to the wild. He is a dancer by nature, often impressing others with his aerobatic feats. He does tend to be a little self-absorbed, often not seeing the problems of others above his own. Alex enjoys his life at the zoo and has plenty of friends and is surprised when hearing Marty's wish to leave and live in the wild (or run free in Connecticut as stated in the movie). As a cub, Alex was born on an African wildlife reserve, and was named Alakay. He was the only son of the alpha lion, Zuba (voiced by Bernie Mac), and was constantly given lessons on hunting, though he displayed no interest in the activity. During one of the sessions, Alex was captured by poachers, but the crate he was contained in fell into a river and eventually floated to New York.

The show's executive producers, Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, later served as executive consultants for DreamWorks' next Madagascar spin-off series (All Hail King Julien). == Plot == The Penguins of Madagascar is a spin-off of the Madagascar films. The series follows the adventures of four penguins: Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico, who perform various commando-like missions to protect their home in the Central Park Zoo. The penguins often have to deal with problems caused, or made worse, by their zoo neighbors, King Julien XIII (a ring-tailed lemur), Maurice (an aye-aye), and Mort (a mouse lemur). == Episodes == == Characters == The Penguins of Madagascar features the four penguin characters from the Madagascar franchise, as well as the two chimpanzees and the three lemurs. Characters new to the franchise include Marlene the otter and Alice the zookeeper, among others. Tom McGrath, John DiMaggio, Andy Richter, and Conrad Vernon reprise their roles as Skipper, Rico, Mort, and Mason respectively. All four of the penguin characters are designed differently in the cartoon than they are in the movie to make them more distinguishable and easier to tell apart. Skipper's head is flatter in the series; Kowalski is taller; Rico has an unexplained scar over his mouth, a double chin, and a feathery Mohawk; and Private is shorter, younger, and rounder. Their personalities and abilities were also exaggerated. The texture of the characters was also changed to be better suited for television work. === Main === Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath) is the leader of the penguins. He devises tactics and gives orders. Arrogant, calculating, strict, energetic, paranoid, short-tempered and nearly unflappable, Skipper's raving paranoia and tendency to view even the most ordinary activities as a military operation, combined with his experience in covert ops, has driven him to prepare for nearly any situation, no matter how bizarre or

The Penguins of Madagascar is an American animated television series produced by DreamWorks Animation and co-produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio. It stars nine characters from DreamWorks' animated film Madagascar: the penguins Skipper (Tom McGrath), Rico (John DiMaggio), Kowalski (Jeff Bennett), and Private (James Patrick Stuart); the lemurs King Julien (Danny Jacobs), Maurice (Kevin Michael Richardson), and Mort (Andy Richter); and the chimpanzees Mason (Conrad Vernon) and Phil. Characters new to the series include the otter Marlene (Nicole Sullivan) and a zookeeper named Alice (Mary Scheer). It is the first Nicktoon co-produced with DreamWorks Animation. The series was executive-produced by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle, who were the creators of the animated series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (a spin-off of Pixar's Toy Story franchise) and Disney Channel's Kim Possible. The pilot episode, ""Gone in a Flash"", aired as part of ""Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend"" on Friday, November 28, 2008, and The Penguins of Madagascar became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere. Although the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, The Penguins of Madagascar does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place ""not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe"". At the end of 2010, the show was the number two animated program on television among kids age 2–11 and in basic cable total viewers. The show received praise for its animation quality, regarded as very good for the time. In December 2014, DiMaggio stated that the show ended production. The show's executive producers, Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, later served as executive consultants for DreamWorks' next Madagascar spin-off

66,what is the name of the currency used in switzerland?,Swiss Franc,Swiss franc,"The Swiss franc, ranked as the seventh most traded currency in the world, has gained in popularity mainly due to being a safe-haven currency. Therefore, many governments and financial institutions hold CHF as a hedge against instability in many types of investments and markets. Economy Switzerland has one of the most advanced free market economies in the world, with the service sector accounting for almost 74 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP). In 2020, Switzerland ranked as the 18th largest national economy by nominal GDP, with the country's GDP being estimated at almost US$750 billion. The service sector plays a vital role in Switzerland's economy, especially the Swiss banking industry and tourism. In 2016, it was reported that Switzerland was the world's third richest landlocked country, next to Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Approximately 28 percent of all offshore funds are banked in Switzerland. The country is neutral and not part of the European Union or EEA. It is, however, a part of the single market and has a number of bilateral treaties with the EU. Switzerland's inflation has been relatively low over the years, amounting to 0.4 percent in 2019. History In 1798, the franc was introduced and used until 1803 along with other foreign currencies, with over 8,000 different coins and banknotes in circulation. In 1848, Switzerland declared that the federal government of Switzerland would be the official issuer of money in the country. In 1850, under the Federal Coinage Act, the first Swiss franc was introduced, as the monetary unit of Switzerland, at par with the French franc. In 1865, Switzerland became part of the Latin Monetary Union, along with France, Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium, under which they agreed to adopt the gold standard, legally maintaining it until 2000. In 1945, Switzerland decided to become part of the Brent Wood System. The Swiss franc was pegged to the US dollar. From 2003 to 2006, the Swiss franc was stable against the euro

The Swiss franc, or simply the franc, is the currency and legal tender of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It is also legal tender in the Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia which is surrounded by Swiss territory. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) issues banknotes and the federal mint Swissmint issues coins. It is also designated through currency signs Fr. (in German language), fr. (in French, Italian, Romansh languages), as well as in any other language, or internationally as CHF which stands for Confoederatio Helvetica Franc. This acronym also serves as the ISO 4217 currency code, used by banks and financial institutions. The smaller denomination, a hundredth of a franc, is a Rappen (Rp.) in German, centime (c.) in French, centesimo (ct.) in Italian, and rap (rp.) in Romansh. The official symbols Fr. (German symbol) and fr. (Latin languages) are widely used by businesses and advertisers, also for the English language. According to Art. 1 SR/RS 941.101 of the federal law collection the internationally official abbreviation – besides the national languages – however is CHF, also in English; respective guides also request to use the ISO 4217 code. The use of SFr. for Swiss Franc and fr.sv. are outdated. As previously indicated Latinate ""CH"" stands for Confoederatio Helvetica; given the different languages used in Switzerland, Latin is used for language-neutral inscriptions on its coins. == History == === Before the Helvetic Republic === Before 1798, about 75 entities were making coins in Switzerland, including the 25 cantons and half-cantons, 16 cities, and abbeys, resulting in about 860 different coins in circulation, with different values, denominations and monetary systems. However, the origins of a majority of these currencies can be traced to either the French livre tournois (the predecessor of the French franc) or the South German gulden of the 17th century. The new Swiss currencies emerged in the 18th century after Swiss cantons did not follow the pace of

67,what is the currency of brazil now?,Real,Brazilian real,"The Brazilian real (pl. reais; sign: R$; code: BRL) is the official currency of Brazil. It is subdivided into 100 centavos. The Central Bank of Brazil is the central bank and the issuing authority. The real replaced the cruzeiro real in 1994. As of April 2019, the real was the twentieth most traded currency. == History == Currencies in use before the current real include: The Portuguese real from the 16th to 18th centuries, with 1,000 réis called the milréis. The old Brazilian real from 1747 to 1942, with 1,000 réis also called the milréis. The first cruzeiro from 1942 to 1967, at 1 cruzeiro = 1 milréis or 1,000 réis. The cruzeiro novo from 1967 to 1970, at 1 cruzeiro novo = 1,000 first cruzeiros. From 1970 it was simply called the (second) cruzeiro and was used until 1986. The cruzado from 1986 to 1989, at 1 cruzado = 1,000 second cruzeiros. The cruzado novo from 1989 to 1990, at 1 cruzado novo = 1,000 cruzados. From 1990, because of the Plano Collor it was renamed the (third) cruzeiro and was used until 1993. The cruzeiro real (CR$) from 1993 to 1994, at 1 cruzeiro real = 1,000 third cruzeiros. The current real was introduced in 1994 at 1 real = 2,750 cruzeiros reais. The modern real (Portuguese plural reais or English plural reals) was introduced on 1 July 1994, during the presidency of Itamar Franco, when Rubens Ricupero was the Minister of Finance as part of a broader plan to stabilize the Brazilian economy, known as the Plano Real. The new currency replaced the short-lived cruzeiro real (CR$). The reform included the demonetisation of the cruzeiro real and required a massive banknote replacement. At its introduction, the real was defined to be equal to 1 unidade real de valor (URV, ""real value unit"") a non-circulating currency unit. At the same time, the URV was defined to be worth 2,750 cruzeiros reais, which was the average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the cruzeiro real on that day. As a consequence, the real was worth exactly one U.S. dollar when it

In 1994, the Brazilian real replaced the cruzeiro real at the rate of 1 Brazilian real to 2,750 cruzeiro reals, the average exchange rate of the US dollar. It was done to stabilise the country's economy. From 1996 to 1998, the Central Bank of Brazil controlled the exchange rate of the Brazilian real and the US dollar. In 1999, the Brazilian real became a floating currency, experiencing a significant devaluation amounting to 1 USD = 2 BRL.

What is the currency they use in Brazil? Real is the currency used in Brazil The currency in Brazil is called the Real (BRL). This money began to be used in Rio in 1994 and was a great move as it has led to very low inflation. Exchanging Money in Rio There are several different exchange rates in Rio but three are of concern to the visitor. The official rate oversees any business deals. The tourist rate is used for tourists making purchases in the country using credit cards. Finally, the parallel rate is the rate used to convert your cash into Reals anywhere in Rio except the banks. Using Money in Rio The United States dollar is quite easy to exchange in Rio de Janeiro. Travelers are advised to either bring American dollars or travel money cards. Of course, all major credit cards are also accepted. How to Exchange Money Do not exchange money prior to arriving in Rio, as the exchange rate will probably be excessively high. Customs allows visitors to bring up to $10,000 into the country without having to declare it. This is the best way to exchange your dollars into Reals. Wait until you get to Rio as the exchange rates will probably be more favorable. Other Options for Getting Cash If you do not wish to carry a lot of cash then consider a cash card. These can also be used at ATM kiosks. These cashpoints do run out of money fairly quickly during holidays such as the Carnival so plan ahead. Most of these cash machines close at 10 pm. Getting cash in Brazil is fairly easy. There are several banks and ATMS throughout the city that can be accessed.

to be worth 2,750 cruzeiros reais, which was the average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the cruzeiro real on that day. As a consequence, the real was worth exactly one U.S. dollar when it was introduced; as of June 2024, that was equivalent to R$8,08 corrected for inflation. Combined with all previous currency changes in the country's history, this reform made the new real equal to 2.75 × 1018 (2.75 quintillion) of Brazil's original réis. Soon after its introduction, the real unexpectedly gained value against the U.S. dollar, due to large capital inflows in late 1994 and 1995. During that period it attained its maximum dollar value ever, about US$1.20=R$1. Between 1996 and 1998 the exchange rate was tightly controlled by the Central Bank of Brazil, so that the real depreciated slowly and smoothly to the dollar, dropping from near US$1=R$1 to about US$1=R$1.2 by the end of 1998. In January 1999 the deterioration of the international markets, disrupted by the Russian default, forced the Central Bank, under its new president Arminio Fraga, to float the exchange rate. This decision produced a major devaluation, to a rate of almost US$1=R$2. In the following years, the currency's value against the dollar followed an erratic but mostly downward path from 1999 until late 2002, when the prospect of the election of leftist candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, considered a radical populist by sectors of the financial markets, prompted another currency crisis and a spike in inflation. Many Brazilians feared another default on government debts or a resumption of heterodox economic policies and rushed to exchange their reais into tangible assets or foreign currencies. The crisis subsided once Lula took office, after he, his finance minister Antonio Palocci, and Arminio Fraga reaffirmed their intention to continue the orthodox macroeconomic policies of his predecessor (including inflation-targeting, primary fiscal surplus and floating exchange rate, as well as continued

It is the home of the National Hockey League's Winnipeg Jets and their American Hockey League affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. The arena stands on the site of the former Eaton's Winnipeg store, and is owned and operated by True North Sports & Entertainment. The 440,000 square feet (41,000 m2) building was constructed at a cost of $133.5 million CAD. It opened on November 16, 2004, as MTS Centre, replacing the since-demolished Winnipeg Arena. It has a capacity of 15,321 for hockey and 16,345 for concerts. == History == With the bankruptcy of the iconic Eaton's retailer, the famed store that was originally constructed in Winnipeg was emptied in late 2001. Various alternative uses for the building (including residential condominiums) were suggested, but ultimately the arena was deemed to be the most viable and beneficial to the city's struggling downtown by Winnipeg Mayor Glen Murray and True North. After a small, but emotional resistance to losing the Western Canadian landmark Eaton's building by some locals and the Save the Eaton's Coalition, which inspired a ""group hug"" of the ""Big Store"" by a reported 180 people in 2001, the store was demolished in 2002 to make way for the new entertainment complex. The arena officially opened on November 16, 2004, replacing the aging Winnipeg Arena, which had been in operation since 1955. In recognizing Eaton's history, red bricks were incorporated into the design of the arena façade, evoking the memory of their store that had once graced Portage Avenue. An original store window and Tyndall stone surround is mounted in the arena concourse to house a collection of Eaton's memorabilia. In addition, two war memorials were incorporated into the building. The Timothy Eaton statue that was once a main feature of the store is also housed on the concourse of the arena, one floor directly above where it stood on the ground floor of the

Originally known as the ""True North Centre"" during its planning and construction stages, it was named MTS Centre as part of a naming rights agreement with Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS). It was renamed Bell MTS Place on May 30, 2017 following Bell Canada's acquisition of MTS. On June 15, 2021, True North announced that the naming rights had been sold to Winnipeg-based Canada Life Assurance Company under a 10-year agreement, renaming it Canada Life Centre. It is often nicknamed ""The Phone Booth"", due to its naming rights having previously held by telecom companies. == Events == === Ice hockey === ==== American Hockey League ==== The AHL's Manitoba Moose were the arena's first tenant, from its opening in 2004 to 2011. The team relocated to St. John's prior to the 2011–12 AHL season to make way for the arrival of the Winnipeg Jets. The Moose returned to the MTS Centre for the 2015–16 season, making the arena the first (together with the SAP Center at San Jose) to be home to both an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. Only the lower bowl, which has a capacity of 8,812, is used for the majority of Moose home games. The arena hosted the AHL All-Star Classic on February 1, 2006, in which Team Canada defeated Team PlanetUSA, 9-4. ==== National Hockey League ==== From 1972 to 1996, the original Winnipeg Jets played home games out of the now-demolished Winnipeg Arena. Facing mounting financial troubles, the franchise relocated to Arizona after the 1995–96 NHL season and became the Phoenix Coyotes.

An earlier trial of wireless telephone service was conducted in northern Manitoba mining towns. === 1950s === At midnight on June 21, 1959, Winnipeg was the first urban area in North America to implement the 9-9-9 emergency telephone number. Also in the late 1950s, MTS located one of its administrative offices on Empress St. near the newly opened Polo Park Shopping Centre complex. In 2000 these employees were moved to 333 Main St., commonly known as MTS Place, where 1,500 employees now work. This formed part of the Province's Downtown First strategy. === 1970s === In the late 1970s, similar to policy changes implemented by AT&T in the U.S., MTS allowed its customers to purchase their own telephone equipment and with this, provided free installation of RJ11 telephone jacks. In July 1979, MTS announced that it would be a pioneer in Telidon-based two-way electronic information services. The trial was called ""Project IDA"" and ran from 1980 to 1981. === 1980s === MTS was a pioneer in offering videotex at the commercial level. In 1981, it partnered with Infomart (then owned by the Torstar and Southam newspaper chains) to create the Grassroots service, providing information relevant to farmers on the Canadian prairies. Customers paid $47.50 per month to subscribe to Grassroots, plus connection fees to DATAPAC. Terminal equipment was manufactured by Norpak.

Bell MTS Inc. (formerly Manitoba Telecom Services) is a subsidiary of BCE Inc. that operates telecommunications services in Manitoba. Originally established as Manitoba Government Telephones after the Government of Manitoba purchased the Manitoba assets of Bell Canada, the corporation was privatized in 1996. On March 17, 2017, Bell regained control of MTS after the Bell Canada group's holding company BCE Inc. closed its $3.9 billion acquisition of the provider and, for regulatory reasons, Bell divested approximately one third of MTS's wireless business (including subscribers and retail outlets) to Telus, and a smaller portion to the new entrant Xplornet. Under Bell ownership, Bell MTS will serve as the headquarters of Bell's telecom businesses in western Canada. == History == === Beginning === One of the first two telephone subscribers in Manitoba was Winnipeg businessman James Henry Ashdown in 1881. === Early 20th Century === MTS is the descendant company of Manitoba Government Telephones, which went into operation in January 1908 after the government of Manitoba bought Bell Canada's Manitoba operations. The Crown corporation became Manitoba Telephone System in 1921, and eventually took over all private telephone operations in the province. === 1940s === MTS announced in late 1947 that it would modernize its long-distance equipment in both Winnipeg and Brandon, using Siemens Brothers Ltd. switching equipment, to better handle routing of automatic dialing of long-distance calls by telephone operators using the currently known Area Code system.

During its four-century history, New York City has been known by a variety of alternative names and euphemisms, both officially and unofficially. Frequently shortened to simply ""New York"", ""NY"", or ""NYC"", New York City is also known as ""The City"" in some parts of the Eastern United States, in particular, the State of New York and surrounding U.S. states. New Yorkers also use ""The City"" to refer specifically to the borough of Manhattan. == Common nicknames == The Big Apple – first published as a euphemism for New York City in 1921 by sportswriter John J. Fitz Gerald, who claimed he had heard it used the year prior by two stable hands at the New Orleans Fair Grounds because of the large prizes available at horse races in New York. Later made popular by a 1970s advertisement campaign. The Capital of the World – made popular in its application to New York by the author E. B. White in his 1948 essay Here is New York, written as construction of the United Nations headquarters began that year. Derived in turn from the Roman poet Lucan who first mocked his city of Rome as ""Caput Mundi"" in the year 61 in his work Pharsalia because of how easily it had fallen to generals the previous century. Also used with adjectives such as ""The Food Capital of the World"" or ""The Gay Capital of the World"", in reference to New York City's outsized influence upon specific cultures. The Center of the Universe – used repeatedly by New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. during his terms from 1954 to 1965, it is also commonly applied to Times Square specifically, and similarly used with adjectives such as the ""Theatrical Center of the Universe"" or ""Economic Center of the Universe"" The City So Nice They Named It Twice – a reference to ""New York, New York"" as both the city and state, spoken by Jon Hendricks in 1959 on a jazz cover of Lorenz Hart and Richard Rodgers' song ""Manhattan"" on George Russell's album New York, N.Y., and popularized by New York-based late night talk show host David

Character of the city New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more images to the collectiveconsciousness of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan.

70,who was jesse james killed by?,Robert Ford,The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"Jesse James Home The End of Jesse James Notorious outlaw Jesse James was shot and killed in this house on April 3, 1882. He was killed by Bob Ford, a member of the James gang, to collect a $10,000 reward offered by Governor Tom Crittenden. Jesse died at the age of 34 after living a lawless career for 16 years. He was living with his wife and two children under the assumed name of Tom Howard at the time of his death. Jesse was shot from behind while he stood on a chair to straighten a picture in his own home. After the shooting, Jesse's wife and two children and his mother, Mrs. Zerelda Samuel, spent the next two nights at Patee House, which was then called the World's Hotel. Current Influence Today the James Home is a museum dealing with the life and death of Jesse James. In 1995 forensic scientist James Starrs exhumed the outlaw's body at Kearney, Missouri, for DNA tests. The results showed a 99.7% certainty that it was Jesse James who was killed here in 1882. Artifacts from the grave are now on display including the coffin handles, a small tie pin Jesse James was wearing the day he was killed, a bullet removed from his right lung area, and a casting of his skull, showing the bullet hole behind his right ear. The Jesse James Museum is operated by the Pony Express Historical Association with all proceeds from admission charges going to help maintain both the James Home and Patee House Museum. About the James Home The James Home was originally located about two blocks north of its present location, at 1318 Lafayette Street, on a high hill overlooking Patee House. In 1939 it was moved to the Belt Highway in St. Joseph as a tourist attraction. Mr. and Mrs. Robert Keatley purchased the James Home in 1977 and donated it to the Pony Express Historical Association. The house was moved back to its original neighborhood and today it is located on the grounds of Patee House Museum.

More About the Legend Frank James also married, and their wives tried to get them to take on a more normal life. With a $10,000 reward on his head, Jesse moved to St. Joseph, Missouri with his family in the fall of 1881 to hide out. On Christmas Eve, Jesse and Zee moved their family into a small house atop a high hill overlooking St. Joseph. Living under the assumed name of Tom Howard, Jesse rented the house from a city councilman for $14 a month. He attended church, but did not work for a living. During the winter of 1882, Jesse tried to buy a small farm in Nebraska, but in April he was short of cash. All of his earlier gang members were either dead or in prison, but Jesse recruited Bob and Charlie Ford to help him rob the Platte City bank. The Ford brothers posed as cousins of Jesse James, but actually were not related to Jesse at all. Legend's End The $10,000 reward on Jesse proved too appealing. While Jesse stood on a chair in the family home at 1318 Lafayette Street in St. Joseph to dust and straighten a picture, Bob and Charlie Ford drew their guns. Bob Ford put an end to the James legend with a single bullet to the back of the head on April 3, 1882. The Ford brothers attempted to collect the reward. Instead, they were charged with murder. They were sentenced to hang, but were pardoned by Governor Tom Crittenden. Two years later, Charles Ford committed suicide and Bob Ford, the dirty little coward who shot Mr. Howard and laid poor Jesse in his grave, was himself killed in a bar room brawl in Creede, Colorado in 1892. Jesse James was a moral paradox. He was a good father and family man, and was religious in his own way. Whether he stole from the rich and gave to the poor, or just kept it all, has never been decided. Jesse James died in 1882, but the legend of Jesse James continues more than a century beyond his death. Today, Jesse and Frank James are among the best-known Americans in the world.

Robert Newton Ford (December 8, 1861 – June 8, 1892) was an American outlaw who killed fellow outlaw Jesse James on April 3, 1882. He and his brother Charley, both members of the James–Younger Gang under James's leadership, went on to perform paid re-enactments of the killing at publicity events. Ford went on to operate various saloons and dance halls in the West, before being killed – at age 30 – by Edward Capehart O'Kelley in Creede, Colorado. == Early years == Robert Ford was born in 1861 in Ray County, Missouri, to James Thomas and Mary Bruin Ford as the youngest of seven siblings. As a young man, Ford came to admire Jesse James for his Civil War record and criminal exploits, eventually getting to meet him in 1880 at the age of 18. Ford's brother Charley is believed to have taken part in the James–Younger Gang's Blue Cut train robbery in Jackson County, west of Glendale, Missouri (renamed Selsa and now part of Independence), on September 7, 1881. == Joining the gang == In November 1881, after the train robbery, James moved his family to St. Joseph, Missouri, and intended to give up crime. The James gang had been greatly reduced in numbers by that time; some had fled the gang in fear of prosecution, and many of the original members were either dead or in prison after a botched bank robbery in Northfield, Minnesota. After the train robbery, James' brother Frank James had also decided to retire from crime and moved East, settling in Lynchburg, Virginia. By the spring of 1882, with his gang depleted by arrests, deaths and defections, James thought that he could trust only the Ford brothers. Charles had been out on raids with James before, but Robert was an eager new recruit. The Fords resided in St. Joseph with the James family, where Jesse went by the alias Thomas Howard. Hoping to keep the gang alive, James invited the Fords to take part in the robbery of the Platte City Bank in Missouri, but the brothers had already decided not to participate; rather, they

Main Navigation The Death of Jesse James Previous Missouri governors had tried to capture the James brothers, employing everything from reward offers to a squad of state-funded secret police. But Thomas Crittenden knew that to catch a thief, you needed a thief, and he finally brought Jesse down with the help of the outlaw's own gang. Jesse James. dead and in coffin, 1882. Library of Congress Return to Crime In the aftermath of the failed Northfield bank robbery of 1876, Frank and Jesse James were forced to hide under assumed names in Tennessee. Jesse chafed at the lack of attention, and in 1879 he decided to return to crime. His old comrades were almost all gone, so Jesse recruited a new gang, men who craved the spoils of banditry but had never served as Confederate guerillas with Jesse and therefore had no deep loyalty to him. Jesse also faced another problem. He had long seen himself as a heroic Southern outlaw, still fighting against Northern oppressors more than a decade after the Civil War was done. But by 1880 Reconstruction was long gone, and Jesse's side had won the peace. Ex-Confederates dominated Missouri politics, and, having won their battle for power, they no longer needed someone who wore a Ku Klux Klan mask while robbing trains. Stripped of this support, Jesse was vulnerable to a concerted push from a determined foe. Crittenden Plots Thomas Crittenden had served with the Missouri State Militia and fought bushwackers during the war. But Missouri's new governor also had practiced law with an ex-Confederate general, and he had no desire to re-fight 15-year-old battles. What Crittenden did want was an end to Jesse's outlaw antics. He railed against the bandit in his 1881 inaugural speech. ""Missouri cannot be the home and abiding place of lawlessness of any character,"" he declared. And Crittenden went right to work rooting out that lawlessness. The legislature had previously made a gesture of support for the James brothers and had limited government reward

chair in his living room and reached forward to dust a picture. Bob and Charlie drew their weapons, and Bob put a bullet in the back of Jesse's brain. Profiters Bob and Charlie Ford were convicted of murder, but Governor Crittenden pardoned them and got the railroad companies to pay out the reward. As it turned out, the Ford brothers weren't the only ones who profited from Jesse's death. A promoter offered his mother Zerelda $10,000 for the body; she refused, but later charged visitors a quarter each to take pebbles from his grave. Jesse's son wrote a book about him, and some 40 years after his death, Jesse's children even appeared in a movie about him called ""Jesse James Under the Black Flag."" Now Streaming The little-known story of a deadly 1898 race massacre and coup d'etat in Wilmington, North Carolina, when white supremacists overthrew the multi-racial government of state's largest city through a campaign of violence and intimidation. When Black neighborhoods across America erupted in violence in the summer of 1967, President Johnson appointed a commission to find the cause for the unrest. Their findings offered an unvarnished assessment of American race relations.",1,1,5,5

Airports are notorious for having unfavourable exchange rates and high markups. It's better to visit any bank in Turkey instead. How much Turkish lira should you take to Turkey?1 Wondering how much money you need for a trip to Turkey? The ideal travel budget for you depends on various factors, such as your own spending habits and where exactly in Turkey you'll be staying. However, consumer prices are approximately 40% lower than in the UK, so you'll surely be able to make the most out of your money. On average, a three-course meal for two in Turkey costs around PS24, which is approximately L970. Eating in cheaper restaurants or street food spots will set you back around PS5 or L200. A cup of coffee or a beer in a Turkish bar costs PS2-PS3 on average or L100 in the local currency.2 Some other daily expenses you should consider are public transport passes, souvenirs and museum tickets. Based on these average prices in Turkey, you'll probably be spending at least PS50 a day per person, or L2,000.2 How to pay in Turkey - which payment methods are accepted?3 All commonly accepted means of payment are also used in Turkey. This means you can pay with your credit or debit card, with cash or through different apps. Although old-fashioned cash is still very popular, it's used less in favour of other methods. In the past couple of years, credit cards have become the primary way of paying in Turkey and they're now being used for over 40% of all transactions. This statistic also includes the usage of charge cards. Debit cards and mobile wallets are used almost equally in Turkey. These two methods account for around 20% of transactions in total. However, you shouldn't rely solely on cards and digital payments. Even though it's easier to tap your card than carry cash, it's important to at least have some change on you. Also, cash is sometimes the only

to take any with me to Europe anymore. (Way back, I used to have $200 or so in 20s in my money belt as an emergency stash...but then I also used to carry Travelers Checks). I'm afraid my response would have been ""take Lira or nothing"" Lots of bits of truth above, but lets cut to the chase: it's a foreign country. They have their own currency and that's what they use. Most people and most businesses in Turkey do not want foreign currency, any more than a sandwich shop in your home town would want someone to come in and try to pay for their meal with Turkish Lira. So generally, in Turkey you should be prepared to deal with Turkish Lira. Yes, there are exceptions: businesses that deal entirely or largely with foreign tourists may have prices posted in foreign currency - though rarely in US Dollars. Usually Euros, sometimes Russian Rubles, and occasionally UK Pounds - it depends on the location and what kind of tourists they get there (in Antalya, sometimes called ""Cuncun for Russians"", we saw plenty of menus in restaurants with prices in Rubles; in other holiday towns where British expats dominate, we saw bars with prices in Pounds). As a rule of thumb, if I see prices in some foreign currency, I figure it's a bad deal. Those places may grudgingly accept or actually want Euros (and maybe some other currencies) will give you a horrible exchange rate to compensate themselves for the inconvenience, so you are pretty much always better off paying in the local currency. Yes, inflation is bad there, but unless your trip to Turkey is very long, it won't impact you. The one business I saw that wanted nothing to do with Turkish Lira were the balloon operators in Capadocia - they insisted on payment (in cash) in Euros or Dollars. Other than those guys, I don't recall ever seeing a business openly offering to take US Dollars. Bottom line: Yes, you will need some cash. That cash should be what everybody else is using: Turkish Lira. Personally, I try to put everything I can on a

Whenever you travel abroad, it's best to take the country's official currency with you. That way, you'll avoid unnecessary exchange fees and any additional charges. The local currency in Turkey is the Turkish lira and each lira is divided into 100 kurus. Some businesses in tourist areas might accept other currencies as well, such as euros, US dollars or pounds sterling. Although that can seem appealing, you should know that they're most likely including a markup. Even if it's more convenient for you to pay in pounds when given the chance, we recommend sticking to Turkish lira. Should you exchange money before travelling to Turkey? In general, there's no need to exchange currency before travelling to Turkey, especially if you have a Wise debit card.

Barbados (UK: bar-BAY-doss; US: bar-BAY-dohss; locally bar-BAY-dəss) is an island country in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies, in the Caribbean region next to North America and north of South America, and is the most easterly of the Caribbean islands. It lies on the boundary of the South American and Caribbean plates. Its capital and largest city is Bridgetown. Inhabited by Kalinago people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other Indigenous peoples, Spanish navigators took possession of Barbados in the late 15th century, claiming it for the Crown of Castile. It first appeared on a Spanish map in 1511. The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536, but abandoned it in 1620 with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited. An English ship, the Olive Blossom, arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625; its men took possession of the island in the name of King James I. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and Barbados became an English and later British colony. During this period, the colony operated on a plantation economy, relying on the labour of African slaves who worked on the island's plantations. Slavery continued until it was phased out through most of the British Empire by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. On 30 November 1966, Barbados moved towards political independence and assumed the status of a Commonwealth realm, becoming a separate jurisdiction with Elizabeth II as the Queen of Barbados. On 30 November 2021, Barbados transitioned to a republic within the Commonwealth, replacing its monarchy with a ceremonial president. Barbados's population is predominantly of African ancestry. While it is technically an Atlantic island, Barbados is closely associated with the Caribbean and is ranked as one of its leading tourist destinations. == Etymology == The name ""Barbados"" is from either the Portuguese term os barbados or the Spanish equivalent, los

with the Caribbean and is ranked as one of its leading tourist destinations. == Etymology == The name ""Barbados"" is from either the Portuguese term os barbados or the Spanish equivalent, los barbados, both meaning ""the bearded ones"". It is unclear whether ""bearded"" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree (Ficus citrifolia), a species of banyan indigenous to the island, or to the allegedly bearded Kalinago (Island Caribs) who once inhabited the island, or, more fancifully, to a visual impression of a beard formed by the sea foam that sprays over the outlying coral reefs. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Visconte Maggiolo showed and named Barbados in its correct position. Furthermore, the island of Barbuda in the Leewards is very similar in name and was once named ""Las Barbudas"" by the Spanish. The original name for Barbados in the Pre-Columbian era was Ichirouganaim, according to accounts by descendants of the Indigenous Arawakan-speaking tribes in other regional areas, with possible translations including ""Red land with white teeth"" or ""Redstone island with teeth outside (reefs)"" or simply ""Teeth"". Colloquially, Barbadians refer to their home island as ""Bim"" or other nicknames associated with Barbados, including ""Bimshire"". The origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. The National Cultural Foundation of Barbados says that ""Bim"" was a word commonly used by slaves, and that it derives from the Igbo term bém from bé mụ́ meaning ""my home, kindred, kind""; the Igbo phoneme [e] in the Igbo orthography is very close to . The name could have arisen due to the relatively large percentage of Igbo slaves from modern-day southeastern Nigeria arriving in Barbados in the 18th century. The words ""Bim"" and ""Bimshire"" are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionaries. Another possible source for ""Bim"" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, where the Rev. N. Greenidge (father of

The United States dollar (symbol: $; currency code: USD; also abbreviated US$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies; referred to as the dollar, U.S. dollar, American dollar, or colloquially buck) is the official currency of the United States and several other countries. The Coinage Act of 1792 introduced the U.S. dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar, divided it into 100 cents, and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents. U.S. banknotes are issued in the form of Federal Reserve Notes, popularly called greenbacks due to their predominantly green color. The U.S. dollar was originally defined under a bimetallic standard of 371.25 grains (24.057 g) (0.7734375 troy ounces) fine silver or, from 1834, 23.22 grains (1.505 g) fine gold, or $20.67 per troy ounce. The Gold Standard Act of 1900 linked the dollar solely to gold. From 1934, its equivalence to gold was revised to $35 per troy ounce. In 1971 all links to gold were repealed. The U.S. dollar became an important international reserve currency after the First World War, and displaced the pound sterling as the world's primary reserve currency by the Bretton Woods Agreement towards the end of the Second World War. The dollar is the most widely used currency in international transactions, and a free-floating currency. It is also the official currency in several countries and the de facto currency in many others, with Federal Reserve Notes (and, in a few cases, U.S. coins) used in circulation. The monetary policy of the United States is conducted by the Federal Reserve System, which acts as the nation's central bank. As of February 10, 2021, currency in circulation amounted to US$2.10 trillion, $2.05 trillion of which is in Federal Reserve Notes (the remaining $50 billion is in the form of coins and older-style United States Notes). As of September 20, 2023, the Federal Reserve estimated that the total amount of currency in circulation was approximately US$2.33 trillion.",1,5,5,1
73,where did tony gonzalez play college basketball?,Missouri,"University of California, Berkeley","Tony Gonzalez Tony Gonzalez was one of the greatest two-sport athletes to ever come through the University of California, Berkeley. As a Golden Bear, he starred as a basketball player despite constantly playing against bigger players and became an All-American as a football player. Beyond Berkeley, he became one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history, becoming a dominant force with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Atlanta Falcons, but his story as a great player truly began to blossom as a Golden Bear. Early Years Anthony David ""Tony"" Gonzalez was born on February 27, 1976 in Torrance, California. Early on, he wasn't too sure of his athletic ability against others. One day as a freshman, everything clicked in a drill on the practice field and he truly began to grow as a player. He realized that timidity could be fatal to an athletic career and that he couldn't afford to back down from anyone. From that day on the practice field and for the rest of his life, Tony Gonzalez was determined to never back down from anyone and to pursue his dreams with gusto and vigilance. He starred in basketball and football at Huntington High School. As a senior, he was named an All-American as both a tight end and a linebacker after recording 62 passes for 945 yards and 13 touchdowns. On the basketball court, Gonzalez was named both the Orange County and Sunset League MVP after averaging 26 points per game. Following his senior year, Gonzalez was shared the Orange County High School Athlete of the Year honors with Tiger Woods. Due to his many athletic exploits, Tony Gonzalez accepted a scholarship to Cal. Freshman Year When Tony Gonzalez arrived in Berkeley in the fall of 1994, he immediately expected greatness from himself. Unfortunately for him, Cal's offense at the time was not very reliant on the tight end position and as a freshman he didn't see as much playing time as he would in subsequent years. He caught just eight passes for 62 yards and one touchdown that year as the Golden

on the tight end position and as a freshman he didn't see as much playing time as he would in subsequent years. He caught just eight passes for 62 yards and one touchdown that year as the Golden Bears went 4-7. Things were a bit different in basketball. Given more of an opportunity to contribute as a forward, Gonzalez averaged 7.1 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. Unfortunately, these contributions did little to help the team win games as they finished 13-14 while finishing last in the Pac-10. However, better days were ahead for Tony Gonzalez and the California Golden Bears basketball and football programs. Sophomore Year The 1995 football season was statistically better for Tony Gonzalez as he caught 37 passes for 541 yards and two touchdowns. However, the players couldn't adapt to coach Keith Gilbertson's approach and finished the year 3-8. When the season was finished, Gilbertson was fired after four years at the helm. The 1995-1996 basketball season was a turnaround year for the program as they finished the year with a 17-11 record, losing to Iowa State 74-64 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Gonzalez played slightly better than the year before but still struggled against bigger competition. He finished the year averaging 5.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. Junior Year Until his junior year, the Golden Bears had not featured a very good football team. When Steve Mariucci was hired as Cal's new head coach in 1996, Tony Gonzalez's football aspirations truly took off. He flourished in the newly installed West Coast offense, catching 44 passes for 699 yards and five touchdowns. As a result of his athletic feats, Tony Gonzalez was named first-team All-Pac-10 and was a consensus All-American. To make things even better, the team enjoyed a 6-6 finish, their first non-losing season since 1993. Though they lost the Aloha Bowl to Navy 42-38, the future looked bright for the program as long as both Mariucci and Gonzalez stayed. However, frustrated with the size

as he averaged 26 points per game. After his senior year, Gonzalez was named the Orange County High School Athlete of the Year, beating out athletes such as golfer Tiger Woods. == College career == Gonzalez chose to attend the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in communications and played both football and basketball. As a member of the California Golden Bears football team, he played tight end under future NFL coach Steve Mariucci. Gonzalez was also an All-Pac-10 and All-America selection. Gonzalez also continued his basketball career at Cal. In his junior year, he played in 28 games, averaging 6.8 points and 5.4 rebounds per game as California made it to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA basketball tournament. Eventually, Gonzalez had to choose a career between basketball or football. On the difficulty of the transition between the two, Tony said ""you get done playing football and then you transition to basketball[, which] had already been going for a month"", but ultimately ""the decision was pretty much made for me..."" Gonzalez decided to forgo his final year of eligibility to declare for the NFL draft. === College football statistics === === College basketball statistics === == Professional career == === Kansas City Chiefs === Gonzalez was ranked as one of the top tight ends in the 1997 NFL draft and was considered a top 15 selection. The Chiefs traded up from the 18th to the 13th selection with the Tennessee Oilers to draft Gonzalez. Gonzalez began his career in the 1997 season. He finished his rookie season with 33 receptions, two touchdowns, and a blocked punt on special teams, helping the Chiefs to finish with the best record in the American Football Conference (AFC). He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team for the 1997 season. In the 1998 season, Gonzalez saw dramatic improvements with 59 receptions for 621 yards, and he also caught two touchdown passes for the second (consecutive) year. The 1999 season saw Gonzalez again improving when he

non-losing season since 1993. Though they lost the Aloha Bowl to Navy 42-38, the future looked bright for the program as long as both Mariucci and Gonzalez stayed. However, frustrated with the size disadvantage in basketball for his height of 6'5"", Tony Gonzalez saw a brighter future in football and decided to turn pro. Mariucci was soon hired by the San Francisco 49ers and Cal's program quickly reverted to its losing ways, winning just three games in 1997. After such an accomplished junior year on the football team, the basketball season figured to be a letdown for Tony Gonzalez. He was training for the NFL Combine and had a bright future ahead of him on the gridiron and it would have been deemed admissible that he loaf through his final year on Cal's basketball team. He didn't see it that way, averaging 6.8 points and 4.6 rebounds on a team bound for the NCAA Tournament. The Golden Bears finished the year 23-9 and lost to North Carolina 63-57 in the Sweet Sixteen. Tony Gonzalez recorded four points and five rebounds in his final game as a Golden Bear. Aftermath When Tony Gonzalez's time as a Golden Bear came to an end, he was drafted 13th overall in the 1997 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. Throughout his 17 seasons in the NFL, Gonzalez constantly used his basketball skills to catch amazing passes over the outstretched arms of overmatched defenders. As one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history, Tony Gonzalez collected 1,325 receptions for 15,127 yards and 111 touchdowns, all records for his position. He retired after the 2013 season and was inducted into the Pro Hall of Fame in 2019. He now serves as a commentator and television personality.

California Athletics Hall of Fame TonyGonzalez Considered one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history and one of the best to every play the position at Cal, Gonzalez was a two-sport letterman for the Golden Bears who starred in both football and basketball. He was named a first-team All-American by Football News and Sporting News, as well as All-Pac-10, in his final season on the gridiron as a junior in 1996. That season, he had 44 receptions for 699 yards and five touchdowns, helping Cal to the Aloha Bowl where he equaled a school bowl record with nine receptions. Gonzalez completed his career with 89 catches for 1,302 yards and eight scores. He enjoyed 16 starts and played in 82 games for the Cal basketball team, contributing 6.4 ppg and 4.3 rpg. As a junior, he helped Cal to the Sweet 16 of the 1997 NCAA Tournament, which included a 23-point effort in a win over Villanova in the second round. The 13th overall pick of the 1997 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs, Gonzalez played 17 seasons and in 270 games in the NFL for the Chiefs and Atlanta Falcons, recording 1,325 catches for 15,127 yards and 111 touchdown receptions before announcing his retirement following the 2013 season. His receptions are the second most in NFL history, while the receiving yards are fifth and touchdown catches sixth, with all three the most ever in the NFL by a tight end. He was a 10-time All-Pro, a 14-time Pro Bowl choice and a member of the NFL's 2000's All-Decade Team.",1,1,5,4
74,where is olympic national park located?,Washington,Washington,"Olympic National Park is a national park of the United States located in Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The park has four regions: the Pacific coastline, alpine areas, the west-side temperate rainforest, and the forests of the drier east side. Within the park there are three distinct ecosystems, including subalpine forest and wildflower meadow, temperate forest, and the rugged Pacific coast. President Theodore Roosevelt originally designated the park as Mount Olympus National Monument on March 2, 1909. The monument was re-designated a national park by Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 29, 1938. In 1976, Olympic National Park was designated by UNESCO as an International Biosphere Reserve, and in 1981 as a World Heritage Site. In 1988, Congress designated 95 percent of the park (1,370 square miles (3,500 km2)) as the Olympic Wilderness, which was renamed Daniel J. Evans Wilderness in honor of the former Washington state Governor and U.S. Senator Daniel J. Evans in 2017. During his tenure in the Senate, Evans co-sponsored the 1988 bill that created the state's wilderness areas. It is the largest wilderness area in Washington. == Park purpose == As stated in the foundation document: The purpose of Olympic National Park is to preserve for the benefit, use, and enjoyment of the people, a large wilderness park containing the finest sample of primeval forest of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, Douglas fir, and western red cedar in the entire United States; to provide suitable winter range and permanent protection for the herds of native Roosevelt elk and other wildlife indigenous to the area; to conserve and render available to the people, for recreational use, this outstanding mountainous country, containing numerous glaciers and perpetual snow fields, and a portion of the surrounding verdant forests together with a narrow strip along the beautiful Washington coast. == Natural and geologic history == === Coastline === The coastal portion of the park

a portion of the surrounding verdant forests together with a narrow strip along the beautiful Washington coast. == Natural and geologic history == === Coastline === The coastal portion of the park is a rugged, sandy beach along with a strip of adjacent forest. It is 60 miles (97 km) long but just a few miles wide, with native communities at the mouths of two rivers. The Hoh River has the Hoh people and at the town of La Push at the mouth of the Quileute River live the Quileute. The beach has unbroken stretches of wilderness ranging from 10 to 20 miles (16 to 32 km). While some beaches are primarily sand, others are covered with heavy rock and very large boulders. Bushy overgrowth, slippery footing, tides, and misty rainforest weather all hinder foot travel. The coastal strip is more readily accessible than the interior of the Olympics; due to the difficult terrain, very few backpackers venture beyond casual day-hiking distances. The most popular piece of the coastal strip is the 9-mile (14 km) Ozette Loop. The Park Service runs a registration and reservation program to control the usage levels of this area. From the trailhead at Ozette Lake, a 3-mile (4.8 km) leg of the trail is a boardwalk-enhanced path through near primal coastal cedar swamp. Arriving at the ocean, it is a 3-mile walk supplemented by headland trails for high tides. This area has traditionally been favored by the Makah from Neah Bay. The third 3-mile leg is enabled by a boardwalk which has enhanced the loop's accessibility. There are thick groves of trees adjacent to the sand, which results in chunks of timber from fallen trees on the beach. The mostly unaltered Hoh River, toward the south end of the park, discharges large amounts of naturally eroded timber and other drift, which moves north, enriching the beaches. Even today driftwood deposits form a commanding presence, biologically as well as visually, giving a taste of the original condition of the beach viewable to some extent in early

The United States has 63 national parks, which are congressionally designated protected areas operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. National parks are designated for their natural beauty, unique geological features, diverse ecosystems, and recreational opportunities, typically ""because of some outstanding scenic feature or natural phenomena."" While legislatively all units of the National Park System are considered equal with the same mission, national parks are generally larger and more of a destination, and hunting and extractive activities are prohibited. National monuments, on the other hand, are also frequently protected for their historical or archaeological significance. Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 433 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations. A bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service ""to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."" Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is

or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS), and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR), with eight national parks in both programs. Thirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2). The national parks set a visitation record in 2021, with more than 92 million visitors. Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944, and had almost 13 million visitors in 2022. In contrast, only about 9,500 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2022. == National parks == Legend === Parks by state or territory === The following table includes the 30 states and two territories that have national parks.

Breadcrumb President Kennedy's Grave in Arlington National Cemetery President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and two Kennedy infants are interred in Lot 45, Section 30, Arlington National Cemetery. The permanent graves are located about 20 feet east of the site where the President was temporarily interred on 25 November 1963. Each is marked by a simply inscribed gray slate tablet. Work on the permanent burial site began soon after the President's death and was completed on 20 July 1967. The grave area, which measures 18 by 30 feet, corresponds in size to many special lots in Arlington assigned for the burial of such other outstanding men as President William Howard Taft, Secretary of War John W. Weeks, General of the Armies John J. Pershing, and General Philip Henry Sheridan. It is surrounded by a stone grave terrace, which lies on the axis from the Lincoln Memorial across the Memorial Bridge to the Arlington House. The grave area is paved with irregular stones of Cape Cod granite, which were quarried about 150 years ago near the site of the President's home and were located by members of his family. Fescue and clover have been planted in the crevices to give the appearance of stones lying naturally in a Massachusetts field. Upon entering the general area, visitors approach the grave by way of a depressed circular walkway to a granite elliptical plaza overlooking the axial vista toward the city. The plaza is bounded by a granite wall, the relatively low top of which is tapered and inscribed with quotations from President Kennedy's Inaugural address and other speeches. From the plaza, another short flight of steps leads to the rectangular terrace and the grave plot. To provide access for handicapped

To provide access for handicapped persons to the President's site, a concealed greenstone walkway has been constructed on the slope north of the grave area. The Eternal Flame, lighted by Mrs. Kennedy on the day of the funeral, now burns from the center of a 5-foot circular flat granite stone located at the head of the President's grave. The burner, a specially designed apparatus which was created by the Institute of Gas Technology of Chicago, consists of a nozzle and electric ignition system. A constantly flashing electric spark near the tip of the nozzle relights the gas if the flame is extinguished by rain, wind, or accidents. The fuel is natural gas mixed with proper quantities of air to control the color and shape of the flame. The entire site, with a total area of about 3.2 acres, was set aside by the Secretary of the Army with the approval of the Secretary of Defense to honor the memory of the President. The land has been retained for the nation as a whole and has not been deeded to the Kennedy family. The steep hillside had never been considered suitable for graves or a general burial section. The area now is appropriately landscaped with new plantings mingled among some of the historic trees. While magnolias predominate, there are crab apple, willow oak, hawthorn, yellow wood, American holly, and cherry trees interspersed among flowering plants and shrubs. Some of the larger trees were selected for their grace and beauty from nearby locations and were donated to the Government by their owners. Actual costs in the immediate grave area were paid by the Kennedy family. The Government was responsible for the improvements in the surrounding area that were provided for the accommodation of the visiting public.

76,where do burmese cats originate from?,Myanmar,Asia,"Everything You Should Know About Burmese Cats If you're a cat lover, you've probably heard of the Burmese cat. Known for its striking appearance and playful personality, the Burmese cat has been a beloved pet for generations. But have you ever wondered about the history and origin of this feline breed? Where did it come from, and how did it become such a popular pet? In this article, we'll take a closer look at the fascinating history of the Burmese cat, from its early origins in Southeast Asia to its rise to popularity in the Western world. Whether you're a proud Burmese cat owner or simply curious about the history of this beloved breed, you won't want to miss this deep dive into the fascinating world of the Burmese cat. So sit back, relax, and get ready to uncover the secrets of this fascinating feline breed. Early History of the Burmese Cat - Origins in Southeast Asia The Burmese cat has a long and storied history that stretches back centuries. The breed is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia, where it was known for its striking appearance and playful personality. In fact, the Burmese cat was so highly prized in Southeast Asia that it was often given as a gift to visiting dignitaries and royalty. One of the earliest recorded mentions of the Burmese cat comes from the 14th century, when the Siamese kingdom was at the height of its power. At this time, the Burmese cat was known for its distinctive golden coat and was highly prized by the Siamese royals. Over time, the Burmese cat became more widely available in Southeast Asia, and it quickly gained a reputation as a beloved pet and companion animal. Despite its popularity in Southeast Asia, the Burmese cat remained relatively unknown in the Western world until the 20th century. It wasn't until the mid-1900s that the breed began to gain traction in the United States and Europe, where it quickly became one of the most popular cat breeds in the world. Arrival of the Burmese Cat in the Western World The

The Burmese cat (Burmese: ဗမာကြောင်, Băma kyaung, Thai: ทองแดง or ศุภลักษณ์, RTGS: Thongdaeng or Supphalak, meaning copper colour) is a breed of domestic cat, originating in Burma, believed to have its roots near the Thai-Burma border and developed in the United States and Britain. Most modern Burmese are descendants of one female cat called Wong Mau, which was brought from Burma to the United States in 1930 and bred with American Siamese. From there, American and British breeders developed distinctly different Burmese breed standards, which is unusual among pedigreed domestic cats. Most modern cat registries do not formally recognise the two as separate breeds, but those that do refer to the British type as the European Burmese. Originally, all Burmese cats were dark brown (genetically black), but are now available in a wide variety of colours; formal recognition of these also varies by standard. Both versions of the breed are known for their uniquely social and playful temperament and persistent vocalisation. == History == In 1871, Harrison Weir organised a cat show at the Crystal Palace, London. A pair of Siamese cats were on display that closely resembled modern American Burmese cats in build, thus probably similar to the modern Tonkinese breed. The first attempt to deliberately develop the Burmese in the late 19th century in Britain resulted in what were known as Chocolate Siamese rather than a breed in their own right; this view persisted for many years, encouraging crossbreeding between Burmese and Siamese in an attempt to more closely conform to the Siamese build. The breed thus slowly died out in Britain. Joseph Cheesman Thompson imported Wong Mau, a dark female cat, into San Francisco in 1930. Thompson considered the cat's build to be sufficiently different from the Siamese to still have potential as a fully separate breed. Wong Mau was bred with Tai Mau, a seal point Siamese, and then bred with her son to produce dark brown kittens that became the

that the breed began to gain traction in the United States and Europe, where it quickly became one of the most popular cat breeds in the world. Arrival of the Burmese Cat in the Western World The arrival of the Burmese cat in the Western world is a fascinating story that is still being uncovered today. It is believed that the first Burmese cats arrived in the United States in the late 1800s, brought over by sailors and merchants who had traveled to Southeast Asia. However, these early Burmese cats were not recognized as a distinct breed and were often interbred with other cat breeds, such as Siamese cats and Persian cats. It wasn't until the 1930s that the Burmese cat was officially recognized as a distinct breed in the United States. At this time, a small group of breeders began to work on developing a standard set of physical and behavioral characteristics for the Burmese cat, with the goal of creating a consistent and recognizable breed. These early efforts proved successful, and by the 1950s, the Burmese cat had become one of the most popular cat breeds in the United States. Development of Burmese Cat Breeds - American vs. British One of the fascinating aspects of the Burmese cat is the way in which the breed has developed differently in different parts of the world. In the United States, the Burmese cat is known for its robust build, round head, and short, glossy coat. American Burmese cats are also known for their energetic and playful personalities, which make them popular pets for families and individuals alike. In the United Kingdom, however, the Burmese cat has developed into a slightly different breed. British Burmese cats are known for their more slender build, longer head, and longer, silkier coat. They are also known for being slightly more reserved and dignified than their American counterparts, although they are still beloved pets for many households. Despite these differences in appearance and temperament, both American and British Burmese cats are

and adaptable to different living situations. However, it's important to research and understand their specific needs before bringing one into your home. Conclusion - The Enduring Popularity of the Burmese Cat In conclusion, the Burmese cat is a fascinating breed with a long and storied history. From its early origins in Southeast Asia to its rise to popularity in the Western world, the Burmese cat has captured the hearts and imaginations of cat lovers around the world. With its unique combination of physical and behavioral traits, the Burmese cat is a beloved pet and companion animal that will continue to be cherished for generations to come. Whether you're a proud Burmese cat owner or simply a fan of this fascinating breed, there's no denying the enduring popularity and charm of the Burmese cat.

Robert Bernard Fowler (born 9 April 1975) is an English football coach and former player. He most recently managed Saudi First Division League side Al-Qadsiah. As a player, he was a striker, and is the ninth-highest goalscorer in the history of the Premier League. He is best known for his time at Liverpool, initially from 1993 to 2001. He scored 183 goals in total for Liverpool, earning the nickname ""God"" from the Anfield fans, and he is Liverpool's second-top scorer in the Premier League. He subsequently played for Leeds United and Manchester City, before returning to Liverpool in January 2006. He moved to Cardiff City eighteen months later. He played there for a year before transferring to Blackburn Rovers on a short-term deal. In December 2008, he departed Blackburn and played in Australia with North Queensland Fury and Perth Glory. In 2011, he joined Thai side Muangthong United as a player, but later was appointed player-manager, which he remained until his retirement in 2012. Fowler was capped for England 26 times, scoring 7 goals. He was included in England's squads for Euro 1996, Euro 2000 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup. == Early life == Fowler was born in Toxteth, Liverpool, and brought up in the inner city area of Liverpool. At this time he was known as Robert Ryder, his mother's surname. He lived in Toxteth at the time of the 1981 Toxteth riots, when he was six years old. As a youngster he supported Everton F.C. and regularly attended home and away games. He played regularly for schoolboy team Thorvald, and once scored 16 times in a 26–0 rout. == Club career == === Liverpool === Despite growing up as an Everton fan, Fowler's career began with Liverpool. He signed as a youth team player on leaving school in the summer of 1991, signing professional terms on his 17th birthday, 9 April 1992. Fowler's first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993, when he was an unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers. In

birthday, 9 April 1992. Fowler's first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993, when he was an unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England under-18 team win the 1993 European Championship, before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool's 3–1 win in a second round League Cup tie at Fulham on 22 September 1993. Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five in a senior fixture. He scored his first league hat-trick against Southampton on 30 October 1993 in only his fifth league game. His very first league goal for the Reds had come on 16 October 1993, when an 87th-minute equaliser at home to struggling Oldham Athletic saved the Reds from what would have been one of the biggest Premier League shocks of the season, with a last gasp own goal giving Liverpool a 2–1 win. He scored twice in a 3–3 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on 18 December 1993. His first 13 games for the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club's second top scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, Ian Rush had scored 19. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making an impact in any of the major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built up hope for a brighter future at Anfield after the disappointment of the first two FA Premier League seasons. ==== Success and fame ==== During the 1994–95 season Fowler was a constant member of the Liverpool side, playing in all of their 57 competitive matches, including the

78,what is newcastle metro?,tram system,Tyne and Wear,"The Tyne and Wear Metro is an overground and underground light rail rapid transit system serving Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, and the City of Sunderland (together forming Tyne and Wear). The owners Nexus have described it as ""Britain’s first light rapid transit system"". The system is currently both owned and operated by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive (Nexus), thus is fully under public ownership and operation. The Metro was originally conceived of during the early 1970s, incorporating much of the earlier infrastructure formerly used by the Tyneside Electrics suburban network, with some elements dating back as far as 1834. Construction work began in 1974, the majority of this activity being centred on the building of new tunnels and bridges that linked with several preexisting conventional railway lines that were converted. In parallel, a purpose-built fleet of Metrocars was procured. The initial portion of the Tyne and Wear Metro was opened during August 1980, although construction of the original network was not completed until March 1984. Early on, Metro operations were integrated with local bus services, although this practice ended with the deregulation of the buses during the late 1980s. Multiple extensions to the original network were promptly worked upon; the first of these, from Bank Foot to Newcastle Airport, was opened during November 1991. A second extension, from Pelaw to Sunderland and South Hylton, was completed in March 2002. By 2013, the network comprised a total of 60 stations (these being a mixture of underground and above-ground stations) across two lines, covering 77.5 km (48.2 mi) of track. While the Metro has largely been operated by Nexus directly, for a period between 2010 and 2017, the Metro was operated under a concession by DB Regio instead; upon the expiry of the contract, it returned to being operated by Nexus. Various improvements are underway as of 2024. During 2016, Nexus launched a

operated under a concession by DB Regio instead; upon the expiry of the contract, it returned to being operated by Nexus. Various improvements are underway as of 2024. During 2016, Nexus launched a programme to replace its existing rolling stock, which dates back to the 1980s. The first replacement Class 555 articulated light rail train entered passenger service on 18 December 2024. Under the Metro Flow scheme, announced in March 2020, works costing £103 million are to increase the service frequency from five to six trains per hour, reduce journey times and improve reliability levels. == History == === Predecessor === The present system uses much former railway infrastructure, mostly constructed between 1834 and 1882, one of the oldest parts being the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, which opened in 1839. During 1904, in response to tramway competition which was taking away passengers, the North Eastern Railway started electrifying parts of their local railway network north of the River Tyne with a 600 V DC third-rail system, forming one of the earliest suburban electric networks, known as the Tyneside Electrics. In 1938, the line south of the River Tyne between Newcastle and South Shields was also electrified. Under British Rail in the 1960s, the decision was made to de-electrify the Tyneside Electrics network and convert it to diesel operation, owing to falling passenger numbers and the cost of renewing end-of-life electrical infrastructure and rolling stock. The Newcastle to South Shields line was de-electrified in 1963, followed by the North Tyneside routes, in 1967. This was widely viewed as a backward step, as the diesel trains were slower than the electric trains they replaced. === Planning and construction === During the early 1970s, the poor local transport system was identified as one of the main factors holding back the region's economy, and in 1971 a study was commissioned by the recently created Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority (now known as

Newcastle upon Tyne, or simply Newcastle ( new-KASS-əl, RP: NEW-kah-səl), is a city and metropolitan borough in Tyne and Wear, England. It is England's northernmost metropolitan borough, located on the River Tyne's northern bank opposite Gateshead to the south. It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England. Newcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as Monkchester before taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. It was one of the world's largest ship building and repair centres during the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, but governed as a county corporate after 1400. In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear. The local authority is Newcastle City Council, which is a constituent member of the North East Mayoral Combined Authority. == History == === Roman === The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius (""Hadrian's bridge""), a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius then is estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian's Wall are visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the ""Roman Wall"" can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend – the ""wall's end"" – and to the separate supply fort of Arbeia in South Shields, across the river from Hadrian's Wall. The extent of Hadrian's Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a

the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a major invasion. However, it seems that the Vallum stopped just west of Newcastle, where its role as a secondary line of defence was performed by the River Tyne. === Anglo-Saxon and Norman === After the Roman departure from Britain, completed in 410, Newcastle became part of the powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, and was known throughout this period as Munucceaster (sometimes modernised as Monkchester). Conflicts with the Danes in 876 left the settlements along the River Tyne in ruins. After the conflicts with the Danes, and following the 1088 rebellion against the Normans, Monkchester was all but destroyed by Odo of Bayeux. Because of its strategic position, Robert Curthose, son of William the Conqueror, erected a wooden castle there in the year 1080. The town was henceforth known as Novum Castellum or New Castle. The wooden structure was replaced by a stone castle in 1087. The castle was rebuilt again in 1172 during the reign of Henry II. Much of the keep which can be seen in the city today dates from this period. === Middle Ages === Throughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress. In 1400 Newcastle was separated from Northumberland for administrative purposes and made a county of itself by Henry IV. Newcastle was given the title of the county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne. The town had a new charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1589. A 25-foot-high (7.6 m) stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century. === 16th to 19th

The first matches were played on 17 August 2002 and the last were played on 11 May 2003. Manchester United ended the campaign as champions for the eighth time in eleven years – an achievement made all the more remarkable by the fact that defending champions Arsenal had been in the lead by eight points on 2 March. After defeating Birmingham at the start of the season, Arsenal equalled a top-flight record of fourteen straight wins but failed to extend it in their next game at West Ham United, being held to a 2–2 draw. They remained unbeaten for 30 Premier League games, 23 of which were played away, until late October, and scored in a record 55 consecutive league games, beating the previous record of 47 set by Chesterfield during the 1930-31 Third Division North season. This run ended at Old Trafford on 7 December 2002, when Manchester United won 2–0. Arsenal then threw away a priceless lead against Bolton Wanderers and finally surrendered the title with a 3–2 home defeat to Leeds United in their antepenultimate game of the season, a result that also saved Leeds from relegation. Newcastle United and Chelsea were the remaining Champions League qualifiers, at the expense of Liverpool who had to settle for the UEFA Cup; they would be joined in Europe by Blackburn Rovers for a second successive season, along with Southampton who were back in Europe for the first time since 1984. At the bottom end of the table, West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland were relegated to the Football League First Division; West Ham's 42 points from a 38-game season was a record for a relegated team.

The UEFA Champions League is a seasonal football competition established in 1955. Prior to the 1992–93 season, the tournament was named the European Cup. The UEFA Champions League is open to the league champions of all UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) member associations (except Liechtenstein, which has no league competition), as well as to the clubs finishing from second to fourth position in the strongest leagues. Originally, only the champions of their respective national league and the defending champions of the competition were allowed to participate. However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well, and again in 1999 when third and fourth-placed teams of the said leagues also became eligible. In the Champions League era, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition. Teams that have won the UEFA Champions League three consecutive times, or five times overall, receive a multiple-winner badge. Six teams have earned this privilege: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Liverpool, and Barcelona. Until 2009, clubs that had earned that badge were allowed to keep the European Champion Clubs' Cup and a new one was commissioned; since 2009, the winning team each year has received a full-size replica of the trophy, while the original is retained by UEFA. A total of 23 clubs have won the Champions League/European Cup. Real Madrid holds the record for the most victories, having won the competition 15 times, including the inaugural edition. They have also won the competition the most consecutive times, with five straight titles from 1956 to 1960. Juventus have been runners-up the most times, losing seven finals. Atlético Madrid is the only team to reach three finals without having won the trophy while Reims and Valencia have finished as runners-up twice without winning. Spain has

Hawaii was characterized by Mark Twain as ""the loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean."" The name is thought to derive from Hawaiki, the former name of Raiatea, the ancestral home of Polynesians. Hawaii is economically vigorous, with diversified agriculture and manufacturing. Hawaiian activities of national and international importance include research and development in oceanography, geophysics, astronomy, satellite communications, and biomedicine. Often called the Crossroads of the Pacific, the state is strategically important to the global defense system of the United States and serves as a transportation hub of the Pacific basin. Finally, Hawaii is a cultural centre and a major tourist mecca. Area 10,970 square miles (28,412 square km). Population (2020) 1,455,271; (2023 est.) 1,435,138. The land area of the state of Hawaii consists of the tops of a chain of emerged volcanic mountains that form 8 major islands and 124 islets, stretching in a 1,500-mile (2,400-km) crescent from Kure Island in the west to the island of Hawaii in the east. The eight major islands at the eastern end of the chain are, from west to east, Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii. Each volcanic mountain formed during the transit of the Pacific Plate across a hotspot (a region of Earth's upper mantle that upwells to melt through the crust) located beneath the central Pacific Ocean, and erupting magma added mass to the crust above. The origin of Hawaii's islands, islets, and seamounts can be traced to at least 70 million years ago, near the end of the Cretaceous Period (145 million to 66 million years ago). Volcanic activity has become dormant, with the exception of the emergent volcanoes of Mauna Loa, Kilauea, and the Lo'ihi Seamount. Mauna Loa and Kilauea are located on the easternmost and largest island, Hawaii (often referred to as the ""Big Island""), where spectacular eruptions and lava flows take place from time to time.

He earned the title of world champion an unprecedented 11 times, including a record five times consecutively (1994-98), and he was also the all-time leader in event wins. Kelly SlaterAmerican surfer Kelly Slater riding the barrel of a wave during a competition in Teahupoo, Tahiti, French Polynesia, on May 10, 2000. The son of a bait-store proprietor, Slater grew up near the water, and he began surfing at age five. By age 10 he was winning age-division events up and down the Atlantic coast, and in 1984 he won his first age-division United States championship title. Two years later he finished third in the junior division at the world amateur championships in England, and he won the Pacific Cup junior championship in Australia the following year. After turning professional in 1990, Slater struggled during his first two years on the professional tour, finishing 90th and 43rd in the world rankings those years. In 1992 he secured podium (top-three) finishes in three of his first five events before winning his first professional tour event, the Rip Curl Pro, in France. His win in that year's prestigious Pipeline Masters in Hawaii secured his first world title, and at age 20 he became the youngest surfing world champion at the time. Slater finished sixth in the 1993 rankings but came back in 1994 to begin a five-year run of complete domination of the world tour, earning the champion's crown every year between 1994 and 1998.

Wiry but strong (5'9'', 160 pounds), Slater could adjust his line from virtually anywhere on the wave; he was faster than any of his peers going into maneuvers, and the angle of his turns was more acute. Frequently powering his moves just past the edge of control--often in the form of a drifting tailslide--Slater trusted that he could find his way back to center before falling off. He also brought aerial surfing in from the sport's fringes, not just because his success rate was higher than anybody else's, but because he smoothly mixed aerials into the ride along with deep-set turns and cutbacks. Slater ran hot and cold during his rookie world tour year in 1991, finished the season ranked 43rd, and was regarded as a longshot contender for the 1992 championship. But he moved into the ratings lead halfway through the 1992 season, pulled away from his rivals, won the title with room to spare in the second-to-last event, then punctuated with the season-ending victory in the Pipeline Masters. At 20, he was pro surfing's youngest-ever world champion. Meanwhile, his moves were being studied and dissected by tens of thousands of young surfers around the world, as he starred in Momentum (1992), Taylor Steele's debut video, as well as Kelly Slater in Black and White (1992), the first sponsor-funded video biography. Just weeks after winning the championship, Slater announced that he had taken a supporting role on Baywatch, the banal but hugely successful lifeguard drama TV show starring the buxom Pamela Anderson. Slater left the show a little over a

Kelly Slater Kelly Slater Supernaturally talented pro surfer from Cocoa Beach, Florida; a record-breaking eleven-time world champion (1992, 1994-98, 2005-2006, 2008, 2010-2011 ) who reinvented virtually every aspect of high-performance surfing. ""His competitive statistics numb the brain,"" world champion Shaun Tomson said of Slater, ""and yet his most significant contributions have come from outside the competitive arena. No sportsman in the world anywhere has for so many years been so far ahead of his peers."" Slater was born (1972) and raised in Cocoa Beach, the son of a bait-and-tackle shop owner father, and began surfing at age five. By 11 he was an unstoppable amateur competitor, and in 1984 he won the first of four consecutive United States Surfing Championships titles, two in the menehune division and two in the boys' division. At 14, mentored by aerialist pioneer and surfboard manufacturer Matt Kechele, Slater won not only the boys' division of the Eastern Surfing Festival at Florida's Canaveral Pier, but the pro division as well--turning down the money to keep his amateur status. Turning pro at 18, Slater won the $100,000 Body Glove Surf Bout contest at Trestles in 1990, and signed a six-figure contract with beachwear giant Quiksilver. ""Believe the hype,"" surf journalist Ben Marcus wrote. ""He is a certified phenomenon."" Slatermania, as it was soon being called, was helped by the fact that the brown-haired, green-eyed Floridian was incredibly handsome. Surfer magazine compared him to a young Elvis Presley. Surf journalist Derek Rielly, playing on the newcomer's deification--but as astounded by his talent as anyone--wrote that seeing Slater surf for the first time was ""like being led by the infant Jesus to the promised land."" People magazine included Slater in its 1991 ""50 Most Beautiful People"" issue. Slater's range and repertoire would expand in the years ahead, but at age 18 the basics were already in place. His stance and balance were similar to those of

answer: no, but he was close). In 2010 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan resolution honoring Slater's competitive achievements. GQ magazine put him on the cover of a 2011 issue dedicated to the ""25 Coolest Athletes of All Time,"" a list that included Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, and Arnold Palmer; he also posed nude for ESPN the Magazine's 2010 ""Body Issue."" The National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian added one of Slater's boards to their public exhibition space in 2011. A refreshingly articulate Slater even made a 2009 guest appearance on NPR's popular radio show Wait, Wait...Don't Tell Me! On November 17 2010, the city of Cocoa Beach unveiled a 10-foot tall bronze statue of Slater on a popular waterfront promenade; the mayor officially declared the date ""Kelly Slater Day."" Slater won a record eight consecutive Surfer Magazine Readers Poll Awards from 1993 to 2001; he then repeated the feat from 2004-2012. In 2009 Surfer ranked Slater #1 in their ""50 Greatest Surfers of All Time"" list, just ahead of Duke Kahanamoku (#2) and Tom Curren (#3). In 2000, Slater became the first pro surfer to have his own website. The year 2002 brought his induction into the Huntington Beach Surfing Walk of Fame and the release of Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer video game, patterned on the best-selling Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Slater's first autobiography, Pipe Dreams, was published in 2003; a second book, Kelly Slater: For the Love, co-written with Phil Jarratt, came out in 2008, the same year that he launched the Kelly Slater Wave Company, with the goal of producing world-class artificial waves. In a surprising move that he announced to the world via social media on April Fools Day, 2014, Slater left Quiksilver, his sponsor of 23 years. As of 2013, Slater was unmarried, and living in Santa Barbara, California. In 2011, the website CelebrityNetWorth.com estimated that Slater was worth $22 million.

The Lorax (also known as Dr. Seuss' The Lorax) is a 2012 American animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment, and distributed by Universal. The film is the second screen adaptation of Dr. Seuss' 1971 children's book The Lorax following the 1972 animated television special. Directed by Chris Renaud, co-directed by Kyle Balda, produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy and written by the writing team of Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (who also served as executive producers alongside Dr. Seuss' widow Audrey Geisel), it stars the voices of Danny DeVito, Ed Helms, Zac Efron, Taylor Swift, Rob Riggle, Jenny Slate and Betty White. The film builds on the book by expanding the story of the Lorax and Ted, the previously unnamed boy who visits the Once-ler. The idea for the film was initiated by Geisel, who had an established partnership with Meledandri from a collaboration on Horton Hears a Who! (2008). Geisel approached Meledandri with the idea when he launched Illumination. The film was officially announced in 2009 with the creative team attached, and by 2010, DeVito was cast as the titular character. John Powell composed the score, and also wrote the film's songs alongside Paul. The animation was produced in France by the studio Illumination Mac Guff (the animation department of Mac Guff that was acquired by Illumination in 2011). The Lorax globally premiered at Universal Studios in Hollywood on February 19, 2012, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 2, in IMAX, 3D (known in the film exclusively as ""Tree-D"") and 2D. Critics praised the animation, music and voice acting but criticized the characters and story, while the marketing received backlash for its perceived contradictions to the book's original message. Despite these criticisms, The Lorax was a commercial success, grossing $351 million worldwide against a budget of $70 million. == Plot == Twelve-year-old Ted Wiggins lives in Thneedville, a

The musical score is by Terry Davies, but it includes significant portions of Elfman's film score. Thompson claims Scissorhands is based on a pet dog of hers. She described her dog as follows: ""She was the most soulful, yearning creature I ever met. She wanted to participate in everything. She didn’t need language to communicate. She communicated with her eyes."" She described the character as similar to Frankenstein's monster and Pinocchio in the sense that he is ""an outsider who wants to be an insider"". == Plot == The work ""tells the gothic story of a boy, created by an eccentric inventor, trying to adapt to suburban life with only scissors for hands."" The dance version is set in the 1950s, unlike the 1990 film, which was set in the late 1980s. An inventor's son was electrocuted in a dungeon-like room while holding scissors. In his grief, the inventor creates another ""son"" with flashing scissors for hands. The creation is orphaned when unsavory characters frighten his father to death with some Halloween activities. He then ventures from his gothic origins into a suburban town where his loneliness is reinforced until he is taken in by Peg Boggs and adopted by both her family and the town. In the promotional video for the American debut, Bourne highlights the juxtaposition of the gothic horror setting and the suburban settings of the adaptation. He also notes that San Francisco was a good place for the United States debut of the work in part because as a city it exhibits a tolerance similar to that of the suburbanites in the work. The piece has no spoken words. Like in the film, Edward is equipped with only scissors for hands because his inventor died in the middle of outfitting him. He is discovered in his castle by an Avon lady who brings him into her home. He then wanders into a town where a

83,what happened to dunkirk during ww2?,Evacuation,Battle of Dunkirk,"Table of Contents Dunkirk is a small town on the coast of France that was the scene of a massive military campaign during World War II. During the Battle of Dunkirk from May 26 to June 4, 1940, some 338,000 British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and other Allied troops were evacuated from Dunkirk to England as German forces closed in on them. The massive operation, involving hundreds of naval and civilian vessels, became known as the ""Miracle of Dunkirk"" and served as a turning point for the Allied war effort. Where is Dunkirk? Dunkirk is located in the north of France, on the shores of the North Sea near the Belgian-French border. The Strait of Dover, where the distance between England and France is just 21 miles across the English Channel, is located to the southwest. Because of its seaside location near the borders of three European powers, Dunkirk (known as Dunkerque in French) and the surrounding area have been the site of centuries of commerce and travel, as well as numerous bloody battles. Battle of Dunkirk On May 10, 1940, the so-called ""phony war"" ended decisively when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium in a blitzkrieg (German for ""lightning war"") attack. In the face of such a coordinated strategy, superior air power and highly mobile ground forces supported by panzer tanks, all three countries would succumb quickly: The Germans occupied Luxembourg on May 10, the Netherlands on May 14 and Belgium by the end of the month. Soon after the blitzkrieg began, German forces invaded France--not along the Maginot Line, which the Allies had expected, but through the Ardennes Forest, moving steadily along the Somme Valley toward the English Channel. As they advanced, German forces cut off all communication and transport between the northern and southern branches of Allied forces, pushing several hundred thousand Allied troops in the north into an increasingly small sliver of the French coast. By May 19, General John Gort, commander of the British

What actually happened at Dunkirk? Dunkirk tells of British and Allied troops trapped on a beach surrounded by enemy forces in 1940 Many historians say it was the battle that cost Germany the Second World War. Dunkirk, directed by the acclaimed Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar), tells the epic tale of the chaotic evacuation of British and French Allied troops from Northern France in 1940. Ahead of its public release on 21 July the movie has received excellent reviews from critics. If you compare Dunkirk's score on the review aggregator website metacritic.com with the scores of other films, it ranks among the top five Oscar best picture nominations of the past 21 years, and among the top 10 war movies of all time. The debut performance of One Direction's Harry Styles was also an unexpected hit. What was 'Dunkirk'? Winston Churchill, Britain's Prime Minister during World War II, called it a ""miracle of deliverance"" in his famed We Shall Fight on the Beaches speech in 1940. He was praising the remarkable evacuation of 338,226 British and French troops from the beach and harbour at Dunkirk. Initially it was thought the Germans would reach the beach within two days, allowing time for only 45,000 troops to be brought to safety. But thanks to a combination of German confusion and Allied bravery, enough British and French troops were saved to see out the rest of the war. Why were they on the beach in the first place? After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, the British sent in troops to defend France. However, as Nazi Germany moved forward into Belgium and the Netherlands in May 1940, the allies made a near-fatal error. The French-German border was defended by a series of barriers and weapons called the Maginot Line, but the area to the north was only blocked by a forest. The forest was thought to be too thick to require heavy defence, but the Germans found a way through. They marched around the back of the Allies in France and forced them over

Secondary navigation What you Need to Know about the Dunkirk Evacuations Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk, involved the rescue of more than 338,000 British and French soldiers from the French port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940. The evacuation, sometimes referred to as the Miracle of Dunkirk, was a big boost for British morale. Prime Minister Winston Churchill recognised however that the greatest challenge still lay ahead, as Nazi ambitions now turned toward Britain. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France and the Low Countries, pushing the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), along with French and Belgian troops, back to the French port of Dunkirk. A huge rescue, Operation 'Dynamo', was organised by the Royal Navy to get the troops off the beaches and back to Britain. Admiral Bertram Ramsay directed the evacuation. Ramsay had retired before the war but was recalled in 1939. He and his staff worked in a room deep in the Dover cliffs that had once contained a dynamo, a type of electrical generator, giving the operation its name. 'Dynamo' began on 26 May. Strong defences were established around Dunkirk, and the Royal Air Force sent all available aircraft to protect the evacuation. Over 800 naval vessels of all shapes and sizes helped to transport troops across the English Channel. The last British troops were evacuated on 3 June, with French forces covering their escape. The gently shelving beaches meant that large warships could only pick up soldiers from the town's East Mole, a sea wall which extended into deep water, or send their boats on the beaches to collect them. To speed up the process, the British Admiralty appealed to the owners of small boats for help. These became known as the 'little ships'. Churchill and his advisers had expected that it would be possible to rescue only 20,000 to 30,000 men, but in all 338,000 troops were rescued from Dunkirk, a third of them French. Ninety thousand remained to be taken prisoner and the BEF left

favourable. There were very unusually for that time of year very light winds for most days there was not a lot of surf on the beach. That allowed men to load into smaller boats right on the beaches before boarding for larger ships, an impossible task on windier days, and when there was wind, that played into the Allies hands as well. The wind was from the east which blew smoke from the burning port of Dunkirk across the beach offering a bit of cover from air attack and also there's some low cloud for most of the period of the evacuation. Low cloud over the beach also protected the troops from air attack so they won in every sense weather-wise. Next up was a bit of ingenuity from the naval officer in charge of the evacuation, Captain William Tennant, which goes against one of those classic Dunkirk narratives. One of the things we remember or think we remember about Dunkirk is the little boats who took men off the beaches. Certainly they were there, over 300 of them, but that was a minority of the men who escaped. Most of the evacuation took place across one of the harbour breakwaters at Dunkirk. This was a very narrow thing with a walkway on top of it. Most of the men, I think around 200,000 of the 338,000 men, came off through that route as opposed to the beaches. The harbour mole was so effective because it allowed troops to step right from the harbour onto destroyers or other large ships rather than going through the time-consuming process of taking smaller boats from the beach. The mole was never designed to be used this way, but it was a major factor in making the Dunkirk evacuations such a success. Finally, let's look at the infamous German halt order which gave the Allies valuable time to create a defensive perimeter around the port of Dunkirk. People in the higher German command basically could not believe their luck. They always were assuming that the French would manage to launch a counter-attack and cut off those tanks that were advancing with such speed.

On May 27, after holding off a German company until their ammunition was spent, 99 soldiers from the Royal Norfolk Regiment retreated to a farmhouse in the village of Paradis, about 50 miles from Dunkirk. Agreeing to surrender, the trapped regiment started to file out of the farmhouse, waving a white flag tied to a bayonet. They were met by German machine-gun fire. They tried again and the British regiment was ordered by an English-speaking German officer to an open field where they were searched and divested of everything from gas masks to cigarettes. They were then marched into a pit where machine guns had been placed in fixed positions. A German officer, Captain Fritz Knochlein, gave the order: ""Fire!"" Those Brits who survived the machine-gun fire were either stabbed to death with bayonets or shot dead with pistols. Of the 99 members of the regiment, only two survived, both privates: Albert Pooley and William O'Callaghan. They lay among the dead until dark, then, in the middle of a rainstorm, they crawled to a farmhouse, where their wounds were tended. With nowhere else to go, they surrendered again to the Germans, who made them POWs. Pooley's leg was so badly wounded he was repatriated to England in April 1943 in exchange for some wounded German soldiers. Upon his return to Britain, Pooley's gruesome story was not believed. Only when O'Callaghan returned home and verified the story was a formal investigation made. After the war, a British military tribunal in Hamburg found Captain Knochlein, who gave the fateful order to fire, guilty of a war crime. He was hanged for his offense. Impact of Dunkirk While the German blitzkrieg was undoubtedly successful (France would call for an armistice by mid-June 1940), the largely successful evacuation of the bulk of Britain's trained troops from near-annihilation proved to be a key moment in the Allied war effort. Germany had hoped defeat at Dunkirk would lead Britain to negotiate a speedy exit from the conflict. Instead,",1,1,1,2

Please consider updating your browser or using another. Auschwitz The largest of its kind, the Auschwitz camp complex was essential to carrying out the Nazi plan for the ""Final Solution."" Auschwitz left its mark as one of the most infamous camps of the Holocaust. Key Facts 1 Located in German-occupied Poland, Auschwitz consisted of three camps including a killing center. The camps were opened over the course of nearly two years, 1940-1942. Auschwitz closed in January 1945 with its liberation by the Soviet army. 2 More than 1.1 million people died at Auschwitz, including nearly one million Jews. Those Jews who were not sent directly to gas chambers were selected for forced labor. 3 The Auschwitz complex differed from the other Nazi killing centers because it included a concentration camp and a labor camp as well as large gas chambers and crematoria at Birkenau constructed for the mass murder of European Jews. Where was Auschwitz Located? Auschwitz is the German name for the Polish city Oswiecim. Oswiecim is located in Poland, approximately 40 miles (about 64 km) west of Krakow. Germany annexed this area of Poland in 1939. The Auschwitz concentration camp was located on the outskirts of Oswiecim in German-occupied Poland. It was originally established in 1940 and later referred to as ""Auschwitz I"" or ""Main Camp."" The Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center, also referred to as ""Auschwitz II,"" was located near the Polish village Brzezinka (German: Birkenau). This is about 2 miles (just over 3 km) from the Main Camp. The Germans started construction on Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1941. Auschwitz III or Monowitz was located near the Polish village of Monowice (German: Monowitz). This is about 4 miles (approximately 6.5 kilometers) from the Main Camp. The Germans initially established the Buna subcamp there in 1942. In 1943, it became a concentration camp. The

Auschwitz concentration camp was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland (in a portion annexed into Germany in 1939) during World War II and the Holocaust. It consisted of Auschwitz I, the main camp (Stammlager) in Oświęcim; Auschwitz II-Birkenau, a concentration and extermination camp with gas chambers; Auschwitz III-Monowitz, a labour camp for the chemical conglomerate IG Farben; and dozens of subcamps. The camps became a major site of the Nazis' Final Solution to the Jewish question. After Germany initiated World War II by invading Poland in September 1939, the Schutzstaffel (SS) converted Auschwitz I, an army barracks, into a prisoner-of-war camp. The initial transport of political detainees to Auschwitz consisted almost solely of Poles (for whom the camp was initially established). For the first two years, the majority of inmates were Polish. In May 1940, German criminals brought to the camp as functionaries established the camp's reputation for sadism. Prisoners were beaten, tortured, and executed for the most trivial of reasons. The first gassings—of Soviet and Polish prisoners—took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941. Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month, and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers. Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz, 1.1 million were murdered. The number of victims includes 960,000 Jews (865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival), 74,000 non-Jewish Poles, 21,000 Romani, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and up to 15,000 others. Those not gassed were murdered via starvation, exhaustion, disease, individual executions, or beatings. Others were killed during medical experiments. At least 802 prisoners tried to escape, 144 successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units, consisting of prisoners who operated the gas chambers, launched an unsuccessful uprising.

Auschwitz, NaziGermany's largest concentration camp and extermination camp. Located near the industrial town of Oswiecim in southern Poland (in a portion of the country that was annexed by Germany at the beginning of World War II), Auschwitz was actually three camps in one: a prison camp, an extermination camp, and a slave-labour camp. As the most lethal of the Nazi extermination camps, Auschwitz has become the emblematic site of the ""final solution,"" a virtual synonym for the Holocaust. Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people died at Auschwitz; 90 percent of them were Jews. Also among the dead were some 19,000 Roma who were held at the camp until the Nazis gassed them on July 31, 1944--the only other victim group gassed in family units alongside the Jews. The Poles constituted the second largest victim group at Auschwitz, where some 83,000 were killed or died. Auschwitz was probably chosen to play a central role in the ""final solution"" because it was located at a railway junction with 44 parallel tracks--rail lines that were used to transport Jews from throughout Europe to their death. Heinrich Himmler, chief of the SS, the Nazi paramilitary corps, ordered the establishment of the first camp, the prison camp, on April 27, 1940, and the first transport of Polish political prisoners arrived on June 14. This small camp, Auschwitz I, was reserved throughout its history for political prisoners, mainly Poles and Germans. In October 1941, work began on Auschwitz II, or Birkenau, located outside the nearby village of Brzezinka. There the SS later developed a huge concentration camp and extermination complex that included some 300 prison barracks; four large so-called Badeanstalten (German: ""bathhouses""), in which prisoners were gassed to death; Leichenkeller (""corpse cellars""), in which their bodies were stored; and Einascherungsofen (""cremating ovens""). Another camp (Buna-Monowitz), near the village of Dwory, later called Auschwitz III, became in May 1942 a slave-labour camp

Auschwitz, also known as Auschwitz-Birkenau, opened in 1940 and was the largest of the Nazi concentration and death camps. Located in southern Poland, Auschwitz initially served as a detention center for political prisoners. However, it evolved into a network of camps where Jewish people and other perceived enemies of the Nazi state were exterminated, often in gas chambers, or used as slave labor. Some prisoners were also subjected to barbaric medical experiments led by Josef Mengele (1911-79). During World War II (1939-45), more than 1 million people, by some accounts, lost their lives at Auschwitz. In January 1945, with the Soviet army approaching, Nazi officials ordered the camp abandoned and sent an estimated 60,000 prisoners on a forced march to other locations. When the Soviets entered Auschwitz, they found thousands of emaciated detainees and piles of corpses left behind. Auschwitz Auschwitz: Genesis of Death Camps After the start of World War II, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), the chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, implemented a policy that came to be known as the ""Final Solution."" Hitler was determined not just to isolate Jews in Germany and countries annexed by the Nazis, subjecting them to dehumanizing regulations and random acts of violence. Instead, he became convinced that his ""Jewish problem"" would be solved only with the elimination of every Jew in his domain, along with artists, educators, Romas, communists, homosexuals, the mentally and physically handicapped and others deemed unfit for survival in Nazi Germany. Did you know? In October 1944, a group of Auschwitz ""Sonderkommando,"" young Jewish males responsible for removing corpses from crematoriums and gas chambers, staged a revolt. They assaulted their guards, using tools and makeshift explosives, and demolished a crematorium. All were apprehended and killed. To complete this mission, Hitler ordered the construction of death camps. Unlike concentration camps, which had existed in Germany since

to be taken to labor camps, but in reality, from 1942 onward, deportation for most Jews meant transit to killing centers and then death. Auschwitz was the largest camp established by the Germans. It was a complex of camps, including a concentration, extermination, and forced-labor camp. It was located at the town of Oswiecim near the prewar German-Polish border in Eastern Upper Silesia, an area annexed to Germany in 1939. Auschwitz I was the main camp and the first camp established at Oswiecim. Auschwitz II (Birkenau) was the killing center at Auschwitz. Trains arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau almost daily with transports of Jews from virtually every German-occupied country of Europe. Auschwitz III, also called Buna or Monowitz, was established in Monowice to provide forced laborers for nearby factories, including the I.G. Farben works. At least 1.1 million Jews were killed in Auschwitz. Other victims included between 70,000 and 75,000 Poles, 21,000 Roma, and about 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war. Auschwitz played a central role in the ""Final Solution,"" the Nazi plan to murder the Jews of Europe. The Nazis deported Jews from nearly every European country to the Auschwitz II (Birkenau) killing center in occupied Poland. In all, at least 1.1 million Jews and tens of thousands of other people perished in Auschwitz. Number of Victims It is estimated that the SS and police deported at least 1.3 million people to the Auschwitz camp complex between 1940 and 1945. Of these deportees, approximately 1.1 million people were murdered. The best estimates of the number of victims at the Auschwitz camp complex, including the killing center at Auschwitz-Birkenau, between 1940 and 1945 are: During the Holocaust, concentration camp prisoners received tattoos only at one location, Auschwitz. Incoming prisoners were assigned a camp serial number which was sewn to their prison uniforms. Only those prisoners selected for work were issued serial numbers; those prisoners sent directly to the",1,1,3,5

Range The rainforests of South America -- The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world, once covering almost half the South American continent. It once stretched across Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Suriname. The Amazon rainforest is being cut down daily and has shrunk to a fraction of its original size. The rapid rate at which it is disappearing makes an accurate range impossible to record. Habitat Description The Amazon is a wild and busy place. The air clings like a cloud, hot and moist. The smell is thick with rotting leaves and strong, sweet flower scents. Birds screech from overhead. Hidden animals scurry beneath the foliage causing leaves to rustle, as they search among the trees for food. Insects buzz and hum, and ants march in armies. This is the rainforest. Animals Found in This Habitat In the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, a golden lion tamarin scoops insects and other small animals out of a bromeliad for its dinner. A three-toed sloth slowly munches green leaves. Its fur grows a green moss in the wet air. That helps to hide it from hungry meat eaters. It is a lucky thing, for just above the trees a giant harpy eagle soars and looks for an animal to catch with its sharp claws. The trees are filled with sound and color -- a noisy scarlet macaw , a toucan or a spider monkey. On the forest floor, the agouti feeds on an avocado dropped from above. When it's finished, the leftover seed may take root in the rotting leaves, if there is enough light. A tapir nibbles at leaves. Off in the bush a huntingjaguar, one of the biggest predators in the Amazon, sniff the air for the scent of prey. Any animals caught unaware on the forest floor can become a meal for the hungry cat. A butterfly searches for blossoms, and a red-eyed tree frog waits for insects. The rain forest feeds them all. Smaller animals are

The Amazon rainforest, also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 6,000,000 km2 (2,300,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 indigenous territories. The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have ""Amazonas"" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name ""Guiana Amazonian Park"" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of the total area of remaining rainforests on Earth, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species. More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population, and 60 of the groups remain largely isolated. Large scale deforestation is occurring in the forest, creating different harmful effects. Economic losses due to deforestation in Brazil could be approximately 7 times higher in comparison to the cost of all commodities produced through deforestation. In 2023, the World Bank published a report proposing a non-deforestation based economic program in the region. == Etymology == The name Amazon is said to arise from a war Francisco de Orellana fought with the Tapuyas and other tribes. The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was their custom. Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the Amazons of Greek mythology, described by Herodotus and Diodorus. == History ==

The Incredible Rainforests of South America Not all rainforests are alike Rainforests are ecosystems that experience a large amount of annual rainfall. They support an incredible number of plants, animals, and other life forms. Although they occur in different parts of the planet, tropical rainforests are found on and around the equator where sunlight is consistent throughout the year. Nature and Culture International has projects and protected areas in rainforest ecosystems in many types of rainforest in South America. Our work occurs in the lowland Amazon rainforest, cloud forests in the Andes, and the Choco forest of coastal Colombia and northern Ecuador. Andean Cloud Forest: Highland rainforest The extraordinary cloud forests of the Andes are a type of mid-altitude tropical rainforest. When humid air, transpired from the billions of trees in the lowland Amazon, moves west and up the mountain slopes of the Andes, some of it condenses and falls as rain. Some remain in the form of low clouds and mist, which condenses directly onto the foliage of cloud forest trees. Cloud forests extend from about 3,000 feet in elevation up to about 8,000 feet, so temperatures tend to be cooler than in lowland rainforests. The terrain is often on steep slopes, with more open canopy, leading to more vegetation on the forest floor. These higher-elevation forests are characterized by waterfalls and quick-moving, shallow rivers. Cloud forest trees are often covered in plants called epiphytes, which capture much of the moisture found in cloud forests. Clouds and mist condense on the epiphytes' leaves and pool at the bases of epiphytes (providing habitat for insects and some types of frogs). Trees here are generally shorter than in lowland rainforest, hence the cloud forest tree canopy is lower. Nature and Culture is currently working with local communities and authorities in our North Andes Mosaic to protect highland forest in Peru which is essential for providing water resources to over

Rainforest covers the largest part of the Amazon region, most of the Guianas, southern and eastern Venezuela, the Atlantic slopes of the Brazilian Highlands, and the Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Ecuador. The Amazon region is the largest and probably the oldest forest area in the world; it also ascends the slopes of the Andes until it merges with subtropical and temperate regions. On its southern border it mixes with the woodlands of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, with galleries of trees extending along the rivers. Consisting of enormous trees, some exceeding a height of 300 feet (90 metres), the rainforest is composed of an almost incredible number of species growing side by side in the greatest profusion and arranged in different strata. There are about 2,500 species of Amazonian trees. In the region of Manaus, Brazil, for example, 1,652 plants belonging to 107 species in 37 different families were found on about 1,900 square feet (180 square metres). The forests of the swamps (igapos), where the ground is inundated or very marshy throughout the year, cover the lowlands. Characteristic trees are, among others, jacareubas (Calophyllum brasiliense), which is a tall tree with hard reddish brown wood used for heavy construction, araparis (Macrolobium acaciaefolium), abiuranas (Lucuma species), piranheiras (Piranhea trifoliata), and louros-do-igapo (Nectandra amazonum). Undergrowth is dense. In the annually flooded plains known as varzeas, trees are higher and quite diversified; they include oeiranas (Alchornea castaneifolia), a euphorbia (i.e., characterized by a milky juice), and the trumpet tree (Cecropia peltata), a rapid-growing tree of the mulberry family with a light wood. Palms and hevea (wild rubber plants) grow in those forests. The forests of the nonswampy areas are rich in hardwoods, of which acapu (a tree with dark brown wood), pau-amarelo (Euxylophora paraensis), pau-santo (Zollernia paraensis), massaranduba (a Brazilian tree with light

Nature and Culture is currently working with local communities and authorities in our North Andes Mosaic to protect highland forest in Peru which is essential for providing water resources to over two million people who live in the region. Amazon: Tropical rainforest east of the Andes The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical forest on Earth, with the highest density of plant and animal species anywhere. This lowland rainforest is east of the Andes mountain range and spans eight South American countries. The Amazon is impressively large, more than double the size of the next two largest rainforests combined. It is also well known for its mighty Amazon River which is made up of 1,100 tributaries, including the Maranon River which is considered the source of the Amazon in Peru. The province of Loreto, Peru, is facing the second-highest rate of deforestation in Peru. Nature and Culture is currently partnering with Indigenous communities and local authorities through sustainable livelihood projects in our Nanay-Tigre Mosaic. Choco: Coastal rainforest west of the Andes On a strip of forest in western Colombia and Northwestern Ecuador, between the Pacific Ocean and the Andean mountain range is the Choco forest. It is a dense and diverse tropical rainforest that blends with adjoining mangrove forests, rocky cliffs, and coastal plains. It is one of the world's wettest rainforests and one of the most biologically rich areas in the world. Many species here cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, such as the golden poison frog (one of the three most poisonous vertebrates in the world). Between two to three percent of this ecosystem is left, making it one of the most threatened and lesser-known forests in the world. With Nature and Culture International's support, the Bajo Baudo protected area was established in 2018. This is the largest regional protected area ever created in Colombia.

Target found major success in collaborating with various fashion designers to create affordable designer pieces, making them available to the average consumer. This trend in fast fashion allowed shoppers to own designer items at lower prices and also allowed the production and public normalization of copycat styles. Designers noticed that their designs were being copied, and many designers began to adapt; in 2004, the retailer H&M, a prominent fast fashion brand, collaborated with fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld to introduce a one-time collection that proved to be a huge success, as women flocked to H&M stores to own a piece of the designer's 30 selections available in the collection. Stores such as Wet Seal and American Apparel are said to be ""American precursors to the fast fashion empire"". === Ethics === The ethics of fast fashion has been the topic of numerous debates and questioning of business practices. Producing fashion at such fast rates involves less secure working conditions/or wages. It also involves a lot of waste. Americans throw out 14 million tons of clothing a year, with the help of fast fashion. Retailers like Forever 21 and H&M have come under fire, not only for their wasteful fast fashion practices that have grown steadily since the beginning of 2000 but for the involvement of cheap labor. The appeal of fast fashion lies in the copying of higher-end brands; however, after something is no longer trendy it is on to the next, leaving clothes to go to waste, and workers to continue to live on unlivable wages. === The logo purse === At the same time that fast fashion became able to supply vast quantities of imitation luxury goods, Western income inequalities had risen steadily. To create an image of belonging to a higher income group, people sought real or copied branded ""high fashion"" items. In haute couture, designers

The fashions of the 2000s were often described as a global mash up, where trends saw the fusion of vintage styles, global and ethnic clothing (e.g. boho), as well as the fashions of numerous music-based subcultures. Hip-hop fashion generally was the most popular among young people of both sexes, followed by the retro-inspired indie look later in the decade. Men and women aged 25 and older adopted a dressy casual style which was popular throughout the decade. Globalization also influenced the decade's clothing trends, with the incorporation of Middle Eastern and Asian dress into mainstream European, American, and Australasian fashion. Furthermore, eco-friendly and ethical clothing, such as recycled fashions were prominent in the decade. In the early 2000s, many mid and late 1990s fashions remained fashionable around the globe, while simultaneously introducing newer trends. The later years of the decade saw a large-scale revival of clothing designs primarily from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. == General trends == === The rise of fast fashion === The early to mid-2000s saw a rise in the consumption of fast fashion: affordable off-the-peg high street clothing based on the latest high fashion designs. With its low-cost appeal driven by trends straight off the runway, fast fashion was a significant factor in the fashion industry's growth. As affordable clothing became even more important in the entrance to the new age, brands started to develop strategies to keep up with consumers' new spending habits. In 1999, department stores in the US such as Macy's, J.C. Penney, Kohl's and more had sales totaling $230 billion. In the years that followed, that number began to fall. By the early 2000s, the rise of online retail and in-store fast fashion caused department store sales to dwindle as retailers offered new styles quicker than ever before. Retail giants of the new millennium included H&M, Forever 21, and Zara. Target found major success in collaborating with various fashion

Sneaker collecting is the acquisition and trading of sneakers as a hobby. It is often manifested by the use and collection of shoes made for particular sports, particularly basketball and skateboarding. A person involved in sneaker collecting is sometimes called a sneakerhead. Sneaker collecting came to prominence in the 1980s in New York City and can be attributed to two major sources: basketball, specifically the emergence of Michael Jordan and his eponymous Air Jordan line of shoes released in 1985, and the growth of hip hop music. The boom of signature basketball shoes during this era provided the sheer variety necessary for a collecting subculture, while the hip-hop movement gave the sneakers their street credibility as status symbols. Sneakerhead culture has extended beyond shoes designed for particular sports, and overlaps with streetwear trends and styles. By one estimate, the sneaker resale market was worth US$10 billion in 2021. == History == Consumers started to collect, trade and resell sneakers in the 1970s, and the sneakerhead subculture came to prominence in New York City during the 1980s. Sneakers such as the Adidas Superstar and Puma Suede were popularized by b-boys and hip-hop artists, and Nike's Air Jordan line revolutionized the industry with its marketing linked to superstar basketball player Michael Jordan. During the 1960s and 1970s, street basketball was widely played in the streets of the Bronx. One of the important rituals among the players was ""stepsies"", which was a game for everyone to step on a player's new sneakers. A clean pair of sneakers indicated that the player was weak. However, with the rise of hip hop music, a ""clean and fresh"" look gained popularity and the game of ""stepsies"" lost favor. Since the 1970s, there has been a strict rule against combining rival brands. For example, a person wearing Nike sneakers with Adidas track pants would be considered as someone going against the culture. This type of violation lowers a

Jimmy Choo is a British luxury fashion house specialising in shoes, handbags, accessories and fragrances. The company, J. Choo Limited, was founded in 1996 by Malaysian Chinese couture shoe designer Jimmy Choo and British Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. The brand claims to have been a favourite of Diana, Princess of Wales. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired in November 2017 by Michael Kors Holdings, now Capri Holdings. == History == === Foundation (late eighties to 1996) === The brand traces its roots to shoemaker Jimmy Choo who had set up his workshop in the late 1980s out of the converted Metropolitan Free Hospital in the East End of London. He was distributing his shoes at a stall of the local market. He was known by the editors of fashion industry magazines because he could recreate Manolo Blahnik's high-heeled shoes in different colours. Sandra Choi, Choo's wife's niece, joined him in 1989 and quickly became in charge of designing the shoes. In the early 1990s, Choo catered to the global jet set, including Diana, Princess of Wales. ""Choo first met Diana [in 1991] when he was summoned to Kensington Palace by the princess after his name across in the Press. 'I was so excited I could not sleep the whole night. In fact I was so scared of oversleeping that I practically stay awaked.' [...] The subsequent meetings were even less formal and they soon became great friends."" The first ready-to-wear shoes were sold in September 1992 at the Gina store on 42 Sloane Street. In the early nineties, Jimmy Choo met with Tamara Mellon who, as a Vogue fashion assistant, would often ask Jimmy's help in customising shoes. After she quit Vogue, Tamara proposed in 1995 to Choo to develop a luxury, ready-to-wear line of shoes. The company was founded in May 1996 when Tom and Ann Yeardye decided to fund their daughter's idea by investing £150,000 in return for 50% of Jimmy Choo Limited and the right to use the name Jimmy Choo.

87,what do portuguese people speak?,Portuguese,Portuguese,"Would you believe that not everyone knows that Portuguese is the official language of Portugal? Some think that Spanish is spoken here, and although both languages do share many of the same words, pronunciation of European Portuguese resembles more of a Slavic language. Rather guttural at times, Portuguese here in Europe is riddled with plenty of shushing sounds. A friend of ours commented that he enjoyed watching the pretty women on local news channels but was a bit surprised when they began spitting at the camera. Unlike Spanish that is spoken with the mouth wide open in a sing-song fashion, Portuguese is spoken through narrow, closed lips. By keeping the mouth almost closed or in a permanent smile position it makes it easier to make the necessary nasal sounds so common here. Our first Portuguese teacher gave us this tip and the following day as I chatted with locals at the gym, I realized it was true. The friendly receptionist at the front desk of the gym displayed a big, white smile and through her closed mouth came the words ""ola bom dia, tudo bem?"" Whenever a word ends with the letter ""M"" it simply means it's a nasal sound and is pronounced like an ""N"". That phrase translates to ""hello, good morning, is all good?"" Portuguese and Spanish share 89% of their vocabulary and the written word is rather similar which made my husband, Clyde, and I ecstatic when we began learning the language. Having lived in Panama for five years we had a descent grasp of Spanish which surely would help us to learn Portuguese, or so we thought. Phrases like ""?como estas?"" are commonly expressed around the planet and simply mean ""how are you?"" In Spanish the pronunciation sounds just as the words are written. But in Portuguese vowels are commonly swallowed, as they call it, and the letter ""o"" is pronounced as ""oooo"", making that phrase sound more like ""cooomsta"". Yet once we began to learn the rules of European Portuguese, which by the way is far different than its Brazilian

The Portuguese people (Portuguese: Portugueses – masculine – or Portuguesas) is a Romance-speaking ethnic group and nation indigenous to Portugal, a country that occupies the west side of the Iberian Peninsula in south-west Europe, who share culture, ancestry and language. The Portuguese state began with the founding of the County of Portugal in 868. Following the Battle of São Mamede (1128), Portugal gained international recognition as a kingdom through the Treaty of Zamora and the papal bull Manifestis Probatum. This Portuguese state paved the way for the Portuguese people to unite as a nation. The Portuguese explored distant lands previously unknown to Europeans—in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania (southwest Pacific Ocean). In 1415, with the conquest of Ceuta, the Portuguese took a significant role in the Age of Discovery, which culminated in a colonial empire. It was one of the first global empires and one of the world's major economic, political and military powers in the 15th and 16th centuries, with territories that became part numerous countries. Portugal helped to launch the spread of Western civilization to other geographies. During and after the period of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese diaspora spread across the world. == Ancestry == The Portuguese people's heritage largely derives from the Indo-European (Lusitanians, Conii), and Celtic peoples (Gallaecians, Turduli and Celtici). They were later Romanized after the Roman conquest. The Portuguese language–the native language of the overwhelming majority of Portuguese people–stems from Vulgar Latin. A number of male Portuguese lineages descend from Germanic tribes who arrived as ruling elites after the Roman period, starting in 409. These included the Suebi, Buri, Hasdingi Vandals and Visigoths. The pastoral North Caucasus' Alans left traces in a few central-southern areas (e.g. Alenquer, from ""Alen Kerke"" or ""Temple of the Alans""). The Umayyad conquest of Iberia, between the early 8th century

Portuguese Culture and Language The poet Fernando Pessoa once wrote that ""My homeland is the Portuguese language"". And today, more than 200 million people, spread out throughout Europe, Africa, South America and Asia, share that homeland, called Portuguese Language. Portuguese is currently the fifth most spoken language in the world and an official language of Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe and East Timor. It is also used in Macau, territory under Portuguese administration until 1999, and in Goa. It is also the base of around twenty Creole languages and an important minority language in countries such as Andorra, Luxemburg, Namibia, Switzerland and South Africa, due to the numerous Portuguese communities in those countries. It is this universality of the Portuguese language that unites Portuguese, Brazilians, many Africans and some Asians, through the recognition of the Portuguese language as a common cultural heritage. Due to not having a continuous territory, but vast separate regions spread over several continents, and the fact that it is not exclusive to one community, but is felt as its own, equally, in distant communities, the language manifests a great internal diversity, depending on the regions and groups that use it. A language of culture like the Portuguese language, bearer of a long history which is both the raw material and product of several literatures and an instrument of global affirmation of several societies, is not exhausted in the description of its linguistic system: a language such as this lives in history, in society and in the world. It has an existence motivated and conditioned by the great human movements and, at present, through the existence of the groups that speak it. This means that the Portuguese spoken all around the world, meanwhile harmonized by an important Orthographic Agreement, continues to be felt as a single language, a vehicle of communication by excellency and perhaps

Brazilian Portuguese varies from European Portuguese in several respects, including several sound changes and some differences in verb conjugation and syntax; for example, object pronouns occur before the verb in Brazilian Portuguese, as in Spanish, but after the verb in standard Portuguese. Despite differences in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, Portuguese is often mutually intelligible with Spanish.There are four main Portuguese dialect groups, all mutually intelligible: (1) Central, or Beira, (2) Southern (Estremenho), including Lisbon, Alentejo, and Algarve, (3) Insular, including the dialects of Madeira and the Azores, and (4) Brazilian. Standard Portuguese was developed in the 16th century, basically from the dialects spoken from Lisbon to Coimbra. Brazilian (Brasileiro) differs from the Portuguese spoken in Portugal in several respects, in syntax as well as phonology and vocabulary, but many writers still use an academic metropolitan standard. A Judeo-Portuguese is attested in 18th-century Amsterdam and Livorno (Leghorn, Italy), but virtually no trace of that dialect remains today. Typical of the Portuguese sound system is the use of nasal vowels, indicated in the orthography by m or n following the vowel (e.g., sim 'yes,' bem 'well') or by the use of a tilde (~) over the vowel (mao 'hand,' nacao 'nation'). In grammar its verb system is quite different from that of Spanish. Portuguese has a conjugated or personal infinitive and a future subjunctive and uses the verb ter (Latin tenere, Spanish tener 'to have,' 'to hold') as an auxiliary verb instead of haver (Latin habere, Spanish haber 'to have'; in Spanish used only as an auxiliary verb). Until the 15th century, Portuguese and Galician formed one single linguistic unit, Gallego-Portuguese. The first evidence for the language consists of scattered words in 9th-12th-century Latin texts; continuous documents date from approximately 1192, the date assigned to an extant property agreement between the children

88,what countries are members of the security council?,"United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China",Verdict on Kashmir,"The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (also known as the Permanent Five, Big Five, or P5) are the five sovereign states to whom the UN Charter of 1945 grants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council: China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States. The permanent members were all Allies in World War II (and the victors of that war), and are the five states with the first and most nuclear weapons. All have the power of veto which enables any one of them to prevent the adoption of any ""substantive"" draft Council resolution, regardless of its level of international support. The remaining 10 members of the UN Security Council are elected by the General Assembly, giving a total of 15 UN member states on the Security Council, which convenes meetings at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City. == Permanent members == The following is a table of the current permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. == History == Based on the consensus concerning the Security Council's structure agreed upon at the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conference and subsequently at UN's founding in 1945, the five permanent members of the Security Council were the French Republic, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There have been two seat changes since then, although these have not been reflected in Article 23 of the UN Charter, as it has not been accordingly amended: China's seat was originally held by the Nationalist government of the Republic of China (ROC). However, it lost the Chinese Civil War and retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949. The Chinese Communist Party won control of Mainland China and established the People's Republic of China (PRC). In 1971, UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 recognised the PRC as the legal representative of China in the UN, and gave it the seat on the Security Council that had been held by the ROC, which was expelled from the UN altogether. Both the ROC

Membership of the United Nations Security Council is held by the five permanent members and ten elected, non-permanent members. Being elected requires a two-thirds majority vote from the United Nations General Assembly. Elected members hold their place on the council for a two-year term, with five seats contested in even years and five seats contested in odd years. An outgoing member cannot be immediately re-elected. Elections usually begin in June for a term starting January 1. Because of the two-thirds majority requirement, it is possible for two evenly matched candidates to deadlock with approximately half the vote each, sometimes needing weeks of negotiations to resolve. Non-permanent seats are distributed geographically, with a certain number of seats allocated to each of the five United Nations Regional Groups. == Current membership == Permanent members Non-permanent members == Regional Groups == The ten non-permanent seats have the following distribution: African Group: 3 members Asia-Pacific Group: 2 members Eastern European Group: 1 member Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC): 2 members Western European and Others Group (WEOG): 2 members In addition, one of the five African/Asian seats is an Arab country, alternating between the two groups. This rule was added in 1967 for it to be applied beginning with 1968. Electoral timetable * The representative of Arab nations alternates between these two spaces. The odd/even distribution was effectively decided by the January 1946 and 1965 elections (the first ever election, and the first election after the expansion of seats). For each of the six and four members in the newly created seats, the UN General Assembly voted to grant either a 1-year or 2-year term. == Previous Security Council composition == From 1946 to 1965, the Security Council had six non-permanent members. Due to a lack of African and Asian member states, the seats had the following distribution: Latin America: 2 members Commonwealth of

Non-Council Member States More than 50 United Nations Member States have never been Members of the Security Council. A State which is a Member of the United Nations but not of the Security Council may participate, without a vote, in its discussions when the Council considers that country's interests are affected. Both Members and non-members of the United Nations, if they are parties to a dispute being considered by the Council, may be invited to take part, without a vote, in the Council's discussions; the Council sets the conditions for participation by a non-member State.

1946 to 1965, the Security Council had six non-permanent members. Due to a lack of African and Asian member states, the seats had the following distribution: Latin America: 2 members Commonwealth of Nations: 1 member Eastern Europe: 1 member Middle East: 1 member Western Europe: 1 member As decolonization increased the number of Asian and African member states without a group, they began to contest other seats: Ivory Coast substituted a member of the Commonwealth in 1964–1965, the Eastern European seat regularly included Asian countries from 1956, Liberia took the place of a Western European country in 1961, and Mali successfully contested the Middle Eastern seat in December 1964 (the Security Council would be expanded before Mali's term began). An amendment to the UN Charter ratified in 1965 increased the number of non-permanent seats to 10, and the Regional Groups were formalized. The amendment effectively created three African seats and one Asian seat (if treating the Commonwealth seat as a WEOG seat and the Middle Eastern seat as an Asian seat). == Membership by year == === Permanent === === Non-permanent (1946–1965) === === Non-permanent (1966–present) === The African Union uses an internal rotation system to distribute seats based on its subregions: 1 odd-year seat alternates between Eastern Africa and Southern Africa (only Eastern Africa prior to the creation of the Southern Africa subregion in 1979) 1 even-year seat is allocated to Western Africa 1 even-year seat alternates between Northern Africa (the Arab nation seat) and Central Africa (with one exception at the beginning in 1966) Aside from the Asia-Pacific Group also allocating an Arab nation seat every four years (in even years not divisible by 4), other regional groups do not have their own subregional rotation systems.

Robert Griffin IIIBaltimore Ravens quarterback Robert Griffin III during a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, 2019. The team continued its strong play in 2011, when the Ravens won a division title and advanced to another AFC championship game, a close loss to the New England Patriots. The following season the Ravens defeated the Patriots in an AFC title game rematch, and, with a win over the San Francisco 49ers--who were lead by head coach Jim Harbaugh, the brother of John Harbaugh--Baltimore claimed the franchise's second Super Bowl. In 2013 the team's five-year streak of playoff appearances came to an end as the Ravens finished the season with an 8-8 record. The team returned to the postseason the following year and upset the Steelers in its first playoff game before being eliminated in the divisional round. The Ravens were beset by injuries over the course of the 2015 season, which resulted in Baltimore's falling off to a 5-11 record. The Ravens rebounded to a degree in 2016 by going 8-8 and just missing out on a division title. The team slowly improved, returning to the playoffs after capturing a division title during the 2018 season.

Super Bowl XXXV was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion New York Giants to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2000 season. The Ravens defeated the Giants by a score of 34–7, tied for the seventh largest Super Bowl margin of victory with Super Bowl XXXVII. The game was played on January 28, 2001, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, making it the first time Raymond James Stadium has held a Super Bowl. The Ravens, who posted a 12–4 regular season record, became the third wild card team to win the Super Bowl and the second in four years. The Giants entered the game seeking to go 3–0 in Super Bowls after also finishing the regular season with a 12–4 record. Baltimore allowed only 152 yards of offense by New York (the third-lowest total ever in a Super Bowl), recorded 4 sacks, and forced five turnovers. All sixteen of the Giants' possessions ended with punts or interceptions, with the exception of the last one, which ended when time expired in the game. New York's lone touchdown, a 97-yard kickoff return, was quickly answered by Baltimore on an 84-yard touchdown return on the ensuing kickoff. The Giants became the first team since the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII not to score an offensive touchdown and the fifth overall. This was the fourth Super Bowl where the winning team outscored the losing team in all four quarters. Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis, who made three solo tackles, two assists, and blocked four passes, was named Super Bowl MVP. Counting the 1958 and 1959 NFL Championship Games, this was the fourth title game that involved teams from Baltimore and New York, and the first such matchup since Super Bowl III, in which the New York Jets defeated the Baltimore Colts.

Super Bowl XLVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2012 season. The Ravens defeated the 49ers 34-31, handing the 49ers their first Super Bowl loss in their franchise history. The game was played on Sunday, February 3, 2013, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. This was the seventh Super Bowl played in the Superdome, and the tenth to be played in New Orleans, equaling Miami's record of ten in an individual city. This was the first Super Bowl to be held in New Orleans since Super Bowl XXXVI and it was the first to be played there since Hurricane Katrina struck the city in 2005. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game featured two brothers coaching against each other — Jim and John Harbaugh, head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens, respectively — earning it the nickname Har-bowl. Jim's son and John's nephew, Jay Harbaugh, was also on the Ravens' coaching staff. Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games (Baltimore, 1–0; San Francisco, 5–0). The 49ers, who posted a regular-season record of 11–4–1, entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history (and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season), which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise. The Ravens, who posted a 10–6 regular-season record, made their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, having previously won Super Bowl XXXV. Linebacker Ray Lewis, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) from that game, as well as the last remaining member of the inaugural Ravens roster from 1996, also played in this game, his and 49ers wide receiver Randy Moss' last before both retired from professional football.

The Ravens originated when Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell decided to relocate his historic franchise, and he reached a deal with the city of Baltimore to move his team in 1996. As part of the agreement, Cleveland kept the Browns' name, history, and colors for a future replacement team, so the newly renamed Ravens--the moniker stems from the famous poem by Baltimorean Edgar Allan Poe--were technically an expansion team. The franchise's first draft selection was offensive lineman Jonathan Ogden, followed by linebacker Ray Lewis, who quickly became one of the most dominant players in the NFL and helped forge the Ravens' reputation as a team known for its ferocious defense. Jonathan OgdenOffensive lineman Jonathan Ogden of the Baltimore Ravens preparing to block an opposing New York Giants player during Super Bowl XXXV, 2001; the Ravens won the game. After four years without a winning record, the Ravens broke through in 2000. Led by the league's top-ranked defense, the team won 12 games during the regular season and swept through the AFC playoffs, allowing an average of fewer than 6 points per game in the postseason. The Ravens easily defeated the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV the following January, and Lewis was named Most Valuable Player of the game. In addition to Lewis and Ogden, the Super Bowl-winning Ravens squad featured standouts such as tight end Shannon Sharpe and cornerback Rod Woodson. Over the remainder of the decade, the Ravens remained competitive, qualifying for the playoffs in six of the 10 seasons from 2001 to 2010--which included a loss to the rivalPittsburgh Steelers in the AFC championship game following the 2008 season, the first under head coach John Harbaugh--and featuring a defense ranked in the top five for total yardage allowed in six of those years.

However, a partial power outage in the Superdome following the return suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl). After play resumed, San Francisco began to rally, scoring 17 unanswered third-quarter points to cut the Ravens' lead to 28–23. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34–29, the 49ers drove down to the Baltimore 7-yard line just before the two-minute warning but turned the ball over on downs. The Ravens then took an intentional safety in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory. Flacco, who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns, became the fourth consecutive quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP, after Drew Brees at Super Bowl XLIV, Aaron Rodgers at Super Bowl XLV, and Eli Manning at Super Bowl XLVI. CBS broadcast the game in the United States, and charged an average of $4 million for a 30-second commercial during the game, the highest rate for any Super Bowl. According to Nielsen, Super Bowl XLVII was viewed by an estimated average of 108.69 million people in the United States, with a record 164.1 million tuning into at least six minutes of the game.

93,who was king george vi married to?,Elizabeth VIII,Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,"George VI (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death in 1952. He was also the last Emperor of India from 1936 until the British Raj was dissolved in August 1947, and the first head of the Commonwealth following the London Declaration of 1949. The future George VI was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria; he was named Albert at birth after his great-grandfather Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was known as ""Bertie"" to his family and close friends. His father ascended the throne as George V in 1910. As the second son of the king, Albert was not expected to inherit the throne. He spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Edward, the heir apparent. Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stutter, which he learned to manage to some degree. His elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936, but Edward abdicated later that year to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. As heir presumptive to Edward VIII, Albert became king, taking the regnal name George VI. In September 1939, the British Empire and most Commonwealth countries—but not Ireland—declared war on Nazi Germany, following the invasion of Poland. War with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George VI was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared.

George V (George Frederick Ernest Albert; 3 June 1865 – 20 January 1936) was King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India, from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936. George was born during the reign of his paternal grandmother, Queen Victoria, as the second son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). He was third in the line of succession to the British throne behind his father and his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor. From 1877 to 1892, George served in the Royal Navy, until his elder brother's unexpected death in January 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. The next year George married his brother's former fiancée, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, and they had six children. When Queen Victoria died in 1901, George's father ascended the throne as Edward VII, and George was created Prince of Wales. He became king-emperor on his father's death in 1910. George's reign saw the rise of socialism, communism, fascism, Irish republicanism, and the Indian independence movement, all of which radically changed the political landscape of the British Empire, which itself reached its territorial peak by the beginning of the 1920s. The Parliament Act 1911 established the supremacy of the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords. As a result of the First World War (1914–1918), the empires of his first cousins Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany fell, while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor, which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment. He appointed the first Labour ministry in 1924, and the 1931 Statute of Westminster recognised the Empire's Dominions as separate, independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations. George suffered from smoking-related health problems during his later reign. On his death in

the Empire's Dominions as separate, independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations. George suffered from smoking-related health problems during his later reign. On his death in January 1936, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VIII. Edward abdicated in December of that year and was succeeded by his younger brother Albert, who took the regnal name George VI. == Early life and education == George was born on 3 June 1865, in Marlborough House, London. He was the second son of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and Alexandra, Princess of Wales. His father was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and his mother was the eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark. He was baptised at Windsor Castle on 7 July 1865 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Longley. As a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was little expectation that George would become king. He was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, Prince Albert Victor. George was only 17 months younger than Albert Victor, and the two princes were educated together. John Neale Dalton was appointed as their tutor in 1871. Neither Albert Victor nor George excelled intellectually. As their father thought that the navy was ""the very best possible training for any boy"", in September 1877, when George was 12 years old, both brothers joined the cadet training ship HMS Britannia at Dartmouth, Devon. For three years from 1879, the princes served on HMS Bacchante, accompanied by Dalton. They toured the colonies of the British Empire in the Caribbean, South Africa and Australia, and visited Norfolk, Virginia, as well as South America, the Mediterranean, Egypt, and East Asia. In 1881 on a visit to Japan, George had a local artist tattoo a blue and red dragon on his arm, and was received in an audience by the Emperor Meiji; George and his brother presented Empress Haruko with two wallabies from Australia. Dalton wrote an account of their journey

people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. Britain and its allies were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had largely broken away, followed by the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died at Sandringham House, aged 56, of a coronary thrombosis. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II. == Early life == Albert was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), was the eldest child and only daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been ""rather distressed"". Two days later, he wrote again: ""I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her."" The Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: ""I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good."" Consequently, he was baptised",1,1,1,5

He played quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, where he became the league's first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and was the all-time leader in quarterback rushing yards at the time of his retirement. Vick played college football at Virginia Tech, where he won the Archie Griffin Award as a freshman, and was selected first overall by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2001 NFL draft. During his six years with the Falcons, he was named to three Pro Bowls and led the team to two playoff runs, one division title, and an NFC Championship Game appearance. Vick's NFL career came to a halt in 2007 after he pleaded guilty for his involvement in a dog fighting ring and spent 21 months in federal prison. His arrest and subsequent conviction garnered Vick notoriety with the general public, which lasted throughout the rest of his career. He was released by the Falcons shortly before leaving prison. After serving his sentence, Vick signed with the Philadelphia Eagles for the 2009 season. As a member of the Eagles for five years, he had his greatest statistical season and led the team to a division title in 2010, earning him Comeback Player of the Year and a fourth Pro Bowl selection. In his final two seasons, Vick played for the New York Jets and Pittsburgh Steelers, primarily as a backup. He officially retired in 2017 after spending the 2016 season as a free agent. After retiring as a player, Vick pursued a coaching career. He served as the offensive coordinator and advisor of the Atlanta Legends of Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019. Near the end of the 2024 season, Vick was named the head football coach at Norfolk State. == Early life == Vick was born in Newport News, Virginia, as the third of four children to Brenda Vick and Michael Boddie, then unmarried teenagers.

The Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation began in April 2007 with a search of property in Surry County, Virginia, owned by Michael Vick, who was at the time quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons football team, and the subsequent discovery of evidence of a dog fighting ring. Over seventy dogs, mostly pit bull terriers, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized, along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's 15-acre (61,000 m2) property by local, state and federal authorities. The case drew widespread publicity to the issues of animal abuse and dog fighting. It also drew attention to unlawful gambling and drug activities which authorities claim often accompany dog fighting. Subsequently, Vick and three other principals were convicted of federal offense conspiracy charges and imprisoned. Vick was suspended by the NFL, was ordered to pay the Atlanta Falcons back a portion of his earnings, and lost endorsement deals worth millions more. With other creditors also attempting to collect millions of dollars in debts, in July 2008, he filed for Chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcy protection. == Overview == The Bad Newz dog fighting investigation began in April 2007 with a search of property in Surry County, Virginia, owned by Atlanta Falcons' football quarterback Michael Vick, and the subsequent discovery of evidence of a dog fighting ring in Newport News, Virginia.

In July 2007, Vick and three other men were indicted on federal offense and state felony charges relating to a six-year-long continuing criminal enterprise of an interstate dog fighting ring known as ""Bad Newz Kennels"", based upon a local nickname for Newport News, Vick's hometown. Allegations included Vick's direct involvement in dog fighting,

the head football coach at Norfolk State. == Early life == Vick was born in Newport News, Virginia, as the third of four children to Brenda Vick and Michael Boddie, then unmarried teenagers. His mother worked two jobs, obtained public financial assistance and had help from her parents, while his father worked long hours in the shipyards as a sandblaster and spray-painter. They were married when Michael was about five years old, but the children elected to continue to use their ""Vick"" surname. The family lived in the Ridley Circle Homes, a public housing project in a financially depressed and crime-ridden neighborhood located in the East End section of the port city. Local residents interviewed in a 2007 newspaper article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that ""not much [had] changed"" nearly a decade after Vick left. One resident said that there was drug dealing, drive-by shootings, and other killings in the neighborhood, and suggested that sports were a way out and a dream for many. In a 2001 interview, Vick told the Newport News Daily Press that when he was 10 or 11, ""I would go fishing even if the fish weren't biting, just to get away from the violence and stress of daily life in the projects."" Boddie's employment required a great deal of travel, but he taught football skills to his two sons at an early age. Vick was only three years old when his father, nicknamed ""Bullet"" for his speed during his own playing days, began teaching him the fundamentals. Michael subsequently taught the game to his younger brother, Marcus Vick. As he grew up, Vick went by the nickname ""Ookie"", and learned about football from Aaron Brooks, a second cousin who was four years older. Vick and Brooks spent a lot of time at the local Boys and Girls Club. ""Sports kept me off the streets,"" Vick told Sporting News magazine in an interview published April 9, 2001.

96,what genre of art is the mona lisa?,painting,Portrait,"The Mona Lisa ( MOH-nə LEE-sə; Italian: la Gioconda [la dʒoˈkonda] or Monna Lisa [ˈmɔnna ˈliːza]; French: la Joconde [la ʒɔkɔ̃d]) is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as ""the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world."" The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism. The painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797. The painting's global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism—a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arsène Lupin), and the song ""Mona Lisa"" recorded by Nat King Cole—one of the most successful songs of the 1950s. The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962, equivalent to $1 billion as of 2023. == Title and subject == The title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, is based on the presumption

What style of painting is the Mona Lisa? Question: The Mona Lisa: Located in the Louvre in Paris, the Mona Lisa is one of the most famous and valuable portraits in the world. Painted by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, it attracts more than 8 million visitors each year.

would commonly have to sit for hours or days, while the artist captured their likeness. The most recognized painting in the world The Mona Lisa was originally this type of portrait, but over time its meaning has shifted and it has become an icon of the Renaissance--perhaps the most recognized painting in the world. The Mona Lisa is a likely a portrait of the wife of a Florentine merchant. For some reason however, the portrait was never delivered to its patron, and Leonardo kept it with him when he went to work for Francis I, the King of France. The Mona Lisa's mysterious smile has inspired many writers, singers, and painters. Here's a passage about the Mona Lisa, written by the Victorian-era (19th-century) writer Walter Pater: We all know the face and hands of the figure, set in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea. Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has chilled it least. The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire. Hers is the head upon which all ""the ends of the world are come,"" and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed! Piero della Francesca's Portrait of Battista Sforza is typical of portraits during the Early Renaissance (before Leonardo); figures were often painted in strict profile, and cut off at the bust. Often the figure was posed in front of a birds-eye view of a landscape. A new formula With Leonardo's portrait, the face is nearly frontal, the shoulders are turned three-quarters toward the viewer, and the hands are included in the image. Leonardo uses his characteristic

portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement. Why is the Mona Lisa so famous? Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece's celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.S. in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation. The Mona Lisa's fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting's inherent appeal. Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world's most famous painting. It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century. The sitter's mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination. Subject Unraveling the mystery behind the Mona LisaOverview of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, with a discussion of the sitter's identity. The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape. Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo's achievement. The three-quarter view, in which the sitter's position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century. The subject's softly sculptural face shows Leonardo's skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo's studied observations and inexhaustible patience. Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter's hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her. The sense of overall

were inconclusive. History Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519. He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times. Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo's late period. French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist's death, and it became part of the royal collection. For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787-99). Following a period hanging in Napoleon's bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century. In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation. People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum's director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects. Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting. Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa. He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion. Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France. Condition Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age. The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its",1,1,2,1

98,who is the voice of kitt?,David Hasselhoff,Val Kilmer,"Eartha Mae Kitt (née Keith; January 17, 1927 – December 25, 2008) was an American singer and actress. She was known for her highly distinctive singing style and her 1953 recordings of ""C'est si bon"" and the Christmas novelty song ""Santa Baby"". Kitt began her career in 1942 and appeared in the 1945 original Broadway theatre production of the musical Carib Song. In the early 1950s, Kitt had six US Top 30 entries, including ""Uska Dara"" (1953) and ""I Want to Be Evil"" (1953). Her other recordings include the UK Top 10 song ""Under the Bridges of Paris"" (1954), ""Just an Old Fashioned Girl"" (1956) and ""Where Is My Man"" (1983). Orson Welles once called her the ""most exciting woman in the world"". Kitt starred as Catwoman in the third and final season of the television series Batman in 1967. In 1968, Kitt's career in the U.S. deteriorated after she made anti-Vietnam War statements at a White House luncheon. Ten years later, Kitt made a successful return to Broadway in the 1978 original production of the musical Timbuktu!, for which she received the first of her two Tony Award nominations. Kitt's second was for the 2000 original production of the musical The Wild Party. Kitt wrote three autobiographies. Kitt found a new generation of fans through her various voice acting roles in the last decade of her life. She voiced the villains Yzma and Vexus in The Emperor's New Groove franchise and My Life As A Teenage Robot, with the former earning her two Daytime Emmy Awards. Kitt posthumously won a third Emmy in 2010 for her guest performance on Wonder Pets!. == Early life == Eartha Mae Keith was born in the small town of North, South Carolina, on January 17, 1927. Her mother, Annie Mae Keith (later Annie Mae Riley), was of Cherokee and African descent. Though she had little knowledge of her father, it was reported that he was the son of the owner of the plantation where she had been born, and that Kitt was conceived by rape. In a 2013 biography, British journalist John Williams

KITT or K.I.T.T. is the common name of two fictional characters from the action franchise Knight Rider. In both instances, KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module in the body of a highly advanced, very mobile, robotic automobile. The original KITT is known as the Knight Industries Two Thousand, which appeared in the original TV series Knight Rider as a 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. The second KITT is known as the Knight Industries Three Thousand, which appeared first in the two-hour 2008 pilot film for a new Knight Rider TV series and then the new series itself, and appeared as a 2008–2009 Ford Shelby GT500KR. During filming, KITT was voiced by a script assistant, with voice actors recording KITT's dialog later. David Hasselhoff and original series voice actor William Daniels first met each other six months after the series began filming. KITT's nemesis is KARR, whose name is an acronym of Knight Automated Roving Robot. KARR was voiced first by Peter Cullen and later by Paul Frees in seasons one and three, respectively, of the NBC original TV series Knight Rider. A 1991 sequel film, Knight Rider 2000, is centered on KITT's original microprocessor unit transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be his successor, the Knight Industries Four Thousand (Knight 4000), voiced by Carmen Argenziano and William Daniels. Val Kilmer voiced KITT in the 2008–2009 Knight Rider series. == Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT) == In the original Knight Rider series, the character of KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) was physically embodied as a modified 1982 Pontiac Trans Am. KITT was designed by customizer Michael Scheffe. The convertible and super-pursuit KITTs were designed and built by George Barris. === Development === In the history of the television show, the first KITT, voiced by William Daniels, was said to have been designed by the late Wilton Knight, a brilliant but eccentric billionaire, who established the Foundation for Law and

of her father, it was reported that he was the son of the owner of the plantation where she had been born, and that Kitt was conceived by rape. In a 2013 biography, British journalist John Williams claimed that Kitt's father was a white man, a local doctor named Daniel Sturkie. Kitt's daughter, Kitt McDonald Shapiro, has questioned the accuracy of the claim. Eartha's mother soon went to live with a black man who refused to accept Eartha because of her relatively pale complexion. Kitt was raised by a relative named Aunt Rosa, in whose household she was abused. After the death of Annie Mae, Eartha was sent to live with another close relative named Mamie Kitt (who Eartha later came to believe was her biological mother) in Harlem, New York City, where Eartha attended the Metropolitan Vocational High School (later renamed the High School of Performing Arts). == Career == Kitt began her career as a member of the Katherine Dunham Company in 1943 and remained a member of the troupe until 1948. A talented singer with a distinctive voice, Kitt recorded the hits ""Let's Do It"", ""Champagne Taste"", ""C'est si bon"" (which Stan Freberg famously burlesqued), ""Just an Old Fashioned Girl"", ""Monotonous"", ""Je cherche un homme"", ""Love for Sale"", ""I'd Rather Be Burned as a Witch"", ""Kâtibim"" (a Turkish melody), ""Mink, Schmink"", ""Under the Bridges of Paris"", and her most recognizable hit ""Santa Baby"", which was released in 1953. Kitt's unique style was enhanced as she became fluent in French during her years performing in Europe. Kitt spoke four languages and sang in 11, which she demonstrated in many of the live recordings of her cabaret performances. === Career peaks === In 1950, Orson Welles gave Kitt her first starring role as Helen of Troy in his staging of Dr. Faustus. Two years later, Kitt was cast in the revue New Faces of 1952, introducing ""Monotonous"" and ""Bal, Petit Bal"", two songs with which she is still identified. In 1954, 20th Century-Fox distributed an independently filmed

television show, the first KITT, voiced by William Daniels, was said to have been designed by the late Wilton Knight, a brilliant but eccentric billionaire, who established the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG) and its parent Knight Industries. The 2008 film implies that Charles Graiman, creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand, also had a hand in designing the first KITT. An unknown number of KITT's systems were designed at Stanford University. KITT's total initial production cost was estimated at $11,400,000 in 1982 (Episode 5, ""Just My Bill""). The 1991 movie Knight Rider 2000 saw the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) in pieces, and Michael Knight himself reviving the Knight 2000 microprocessor unit, which is eventually transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be the original KITT's direct successor, the Knight 4000. The new vehicle was a modified 1991 Dodge Stealth, appearing similar to the Pontiac Banshee prototype. In the 1997–1998 spin-off series Team Knight Rider, KITT is employed as a shadow advisor. It is later revealed that ""The Shadow"" is actually a hologram run by KITT. In ""Knight of the Living Dead"", Graiman states a third KITT exists as a backup. When KITT is about to die, his memories are downloaded so the third KITT can use them. However, the third backup is never used. While both the 2008 film and the reboot series appear to be a revamp of the original series, they offer some continuity from the original. The ""new"" or ""second"" KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) is a different vehicle and microprocessor unit. In Knight Rider 2000, it is stated that most of the Knight 2000 parts had been sold off. However, Graiman's garage in the 2008 film shows a more complete collection of parts than in the boxes recovered by Michael Knight in Knight Rider 2000. The original Knight Industries Two Thousand is also shown in the pilot movie (although in pieces) in the scene where the garage of Charles Graiman (creator of the

The current times have been fixed since 2007. 1868 -- New Zealand officially set a national standard time -- called New Zealand Mean Time -- at 11 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). 1927 -- New Zealand first observed daylight saving time. The dates and time difference were changed several times over the following years. 1941 -- New Zealand summer time was extended by emergency regulations to cover the whole year. 1946 -- New Zealand summer time (12 hours in advance of GMT) was adopted as New Zealand standard time. Daylight saving time was effectively discontinued at this point. 1974-5 -- Daylight saving was trialled again in 1974, and introduced in 1975. Daylight saving time is 1 hour ahead of New Zealand standard time. 1985 -- Public attitudes were surveyed and over the next few years the period of daylight saving time was extended twice. 2006-07 -- Following public debate and a petition presented to Parliament the period of daylight saving was extended to its current dates. New Zealand observes daylight saving from the last Sunday in September to the first Sunday in April. 2008 -- Daylight saving public attitude survey.

The Inventors of DST The history of DST in New Zealand started more than 20 years earlier. In 1895, the scientist George Vernon Hudson presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society advocating seasonal time adjustments. The society members ridiculed his idea. However, in 1909, the parliamentarian Thomas Sidey proposed to move the clocks 1 hour forward in New Zealand's summer period to allow for an extra hour of daylight in the evenings. Confusing Changes The Summer Time Act 1927, set the clocks forward 1 hour, but the measure was unpopular. The Summer Time Act 1928 reduced the time change to 30-minutes instead. After the Summer Time Act 1929 went into effect, the DST period lasted from the second Sunday in October to the third Sunday in March. In 1933, it was extended to run from the first Sunday in September to the last Sunday of April. In 1941, during World War II, clocks were set forward 30 minutes, increasing New Zealand's offset from GMT to 12 hours. The time change was made permanent by the Standard Time Act 1945. Modern DST in NZ New Zealand's current DST schedule was established by the Time Act 1974. The measure proved so popular that the start and end dates of the DST period were extended several times. Following the Daylight Time Order 1990, DST ran from the first Sunday in October to the third Sunday in March. In 2007, New Zealand's Minister of Internal Affairs, Rick Barker, announced that the DST schedule was to be extended further. The decision was made after a survey and petition found that people favored an extended DST period. DST in New Zealand is today observed from the last Sunday in September to the first Sunday in April.

Time in New Zealand is divided by law into two standard time zones. The main islands use New Zealand Standard Time (NZST), 12 hours in advance of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) / military M (Mike), while the outlying Chatham Islands use Chatham Standard Time (CHAST), 12 hours 45 minutes in advance of UTC / military M^ (Mike-Three). During summer months – from the last Sunday in September until the first Sunday in April – daylight saving time is observed and clocks are advanced one hour. New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT) is 13 hours ahead of UTC, and Chatham Daylight Time (CHADT) 13 hours 45 minutes ahead. New Zealand's associated states – the Cook Islands and Niue – and the dependent territory of Tokelau use several different time zones at their own discretion. == History == On 2 November 1868, New Zealand officially adopted a standard time to be observed nationally, and was the first country to do so, about fifteen years before any other. Chatham Island was 45 minutes ahead of mainland New Zealand [twelve hours and fifteen minutes ahead of Coordinated Universal Time]. It was based on longitude 172° 30′ East of Greenwich, 11+1⁄2 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This standard was known as New Zealand Mean Time (NZMT). In 1941, during the Second World War, clocks were advanced half an hour, to reduce electric power use making New Zealand 12 hours ahead of GMT. This change was made permanent from 1946 by the Standard Time Act 1945, at which the time at the 180°E meridian was made the basis for New Zealand Time. NZST remained half an hour ahead of NZMT, and the Chatham Islands 45 minutes ahead of NZST. In the late 1940s the atomic clock was developed and several laboratories began atomic time scales. A new time scale known as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) was adopted internationally in 1972. This was based on the readings of atomic clocks, updated periodically in accordance with time variations in the Earth's rotation by the addition or deletion of seconds",1,1,2,1

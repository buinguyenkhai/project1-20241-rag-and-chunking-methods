0,what percent of people are overweight in the uk?,63.8%,uk,"1. New in this update 2. Summary This statistical commentary provides background information on the revised and updated indicators in the Obesity Profile on Fingertips and presents England level data. The Obesity Profile also includes England level data on inequalities for these indicators, displaying data by index of multiple deprivation decile, ethnic group, working status, disability, level of education, socioeconomic class, age and sex. 3. Percentage of adults (aged 18+) classified as overweight or obese In 2021 to 2022, 63.8% of adults aged 18 years and over in England were estimated to be overweight or living with obesity. This was an increase from 2020 to 2021 (63.3%). In 2021 to 2022, the prevalence of adults who are overweight or living with obesity remained lower among women (58.4%) than men (69.1%). The prevalence of adults who are overweight or living with obesity varies by age in England, with adults aged between 45 and 84 years having a higher estimated prevalence than the England average. When looking at different ethnic groups, the prevalence of adults who are overweight or living with obesity remains highest amongst those who identified as black (70.8%) or white British (65.2%). 4. Percentage of adults (aged 18+) classified as obese In 2021 to 2022, 25.9% of adults aged 18 years and over in England were estimated to be living with obesity. This was an increase from 2020 to 2021 (25.2%). In 2021 to 2022, the prevalence of adults living with obesity remained similar among women (26.1%) and men (25.8%). The prevalence of adults living with obesity varies by age in England, with adults aged between 45 and 74 years having a higher estimated prevalence than the England average. When looking at different ethnic groups, the prevalence of adults living with obesity remains highest amongst those who identified as black (33.7%) or white British (27.3%). The updated adjustments for height and weight have been applied to the new data point (November 2021 to 2022) and the whole back series (November 2015 to 2016 to November 2020 to 2021). A review of the estimates indicates that for both indicators at England level the values have changed no more than plus or minus 0.2 percentage points. At local authority level for the November 2020 to 2021 estimates, most values remain the same and any changes were no more than plus or minus 1.4 percentage points. 6. Further information Obesity is a global and complex public health concern. It is associated with reduced life expectancy and is a risk factor for a range of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, at least 12 kinds of cancer, liver, and respiratory disease, and can also impact on mental health. The best indicator of obesity prevalence for adults comes from the Health Survey for England, which uses measured heights and weights to calculate body mass index (BMI). However, the survey sample size is not sufficient to produce robust estimates at local level. The obesity related indicators being published here present local authority estimates from Sport England's Active Lives Adult Survey data to help inform local action in preventing obesity and supporting people who are overweight or living with obesity. The indicators use self-reported heights and weights which are adjusted so that they more accurately predicted measured values. The sample size is also sufficiently robust to produce estimates at local level. A detailed description of the methods used to produce the indicators can be found in the definitions data view of the indicators in the Obesity Profile.

Obesity is common in the United States and is a major health issue associated with numerous diseases, specifically an increased risk of certain types of cancer, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease, as well as significant increases in early mortality and economic costs. == Statistics == The CDC defines an adult (a person aged 20 years or greater) with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater as obese and an adult with a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 as overweight. Obesity in adults is divided into three categories. Adults with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 have class 1 obesity; adults with a BMI of 35 to 39.9 have class 2 obesity; adults with a BMI of 40 or greater have class 3 obesity, which is also known as extreme or severe obesity (and was formerly known as morbid obesity). Children (persons aged 2 to 19 years) with a BMI at or above the 95th percentile of children of the same age and sex are defined as obese, and children with a BMI at or above the 85th percentile but less than the 95th percentile are defined as overweight. Compared to non-obese Americans, between 2001 and 2016, obese Americans incurred an average of $2,505 more in medical expenses annually, and in 2016, the aggregate medical cost due to obesity in the United States of America was $260.6 billion. However, some evidence suggests the lifetime cost of medical treatment for obese individuals is lower than for healthy weight individuals. This is because healthy weight people live longer statistically and tend to develop chronic diseases that need to be continually treated into old age, whereas obese people tend to die from metabolic diseases at younger ages and avoid some of those protracted medical costs. While lifetime medical costs for obese individuals may be lower than for healthy weight individuals, obese individuals cause significant economic productivity loss (ranging from $13.4 billion to $26.8 billion in 2016). The obesity rate has steadily increased since 1960–1962, where approximately 13% of American adults were obese. By 2014, figures from the CDC found that more than one-third (crude estimate 36.5%) of U.S. adults and 17% of children were obese. By 2014, figures from the National Institute of diabetes shows that 82% of Americans are overweight. National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC showed that 42.4% of U.S. adults were obese as of 2017–2018 (43% for men and 41.9% for women). For the following statistics, ""adult"" is defined as age 20 and over. The overweight + obese percentages for the overall US population are higher reaching 39.4% in 1997, 44.5% in 2004, 56.6% in 2007, 63.8% (adults) and 17% (children) in 2008, in 2010 65.7% of American adults and 17% of American children are overweight or obese, and 63% of teenage girls become overweight by age 11. In 2013 the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 57.6% of all American citizens were overweight or obese. The organization estimated that 3/4 of the American population would likely be overweight or obese by 2020. According to research done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, it is estimated that around 40% of Americans are considered obese, and 18% are considered severely obese as of 2019. Severe obesity is defined as a BMI over 35 in the study. Their projections say that about half of the US population (48.9%) will be considered obese and nearly 1 in 4 (24.2%) will be considered severely obese by 2030. New data in 2024, reveals the U.S. adult obesity rate decreased by about 2% from 2020 to 2023, according to data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Researchers attribute this decline in part to the increasing use of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic, now used by 6% of Americans. These medications may be helping to reverse the long-standing rise in obesity rates in the country. == Epidemiology == Obesity is a chronic health problem. It is one of the biggest factors for type II

1. Main facts and figures in the year to November 2022, 63.8% of adults aged 18 and over were overweight or living with obesity - up by 0.5% from the previous year 70.8% of black adults were overweight or living with obesity - the highest percentage out of all ethnic groups 33.1% of adults from the Chinese ethnic group were overweight or living with obesity - the lowest percentage in the 6 years to November 2022, the percentage of white British adults who were overweight or living with obesity went up from 62.0% to 65.2% - it also went up for adults in the mixed (from 53.8% to 60.1%) and white 'other' (from 57.0% to 59.1%) ethnic groups the percentages were broadly similar to those from the year ending November 2016 for all other ethnic groups 2. Things you need to know What the data measures The data shows the percentage of adults (people aged 18 and older) in England who were overweight or living with obesity, by ethnicity. People were asked for their height and weight. These figures were used to determine their body mass index (BMI). This indicates if a person is overweight or living with obesity. Not included in the data How BMI is calculated The metric formula for working out someone's BMI is their weight in kilograms divided by their height in metres squared. The ethnic groups used in the data Estimates are shown for 7 ethnic groups: Asian black Chinese mixed white British white 'other' 'other' This means estimates are shown for these groups as a whole. This is because the number of people surveyed was too small to make any reliable conclusions about any of the 19 ethnic groups used in the 2011 Census. People often underestimate their weight and overestimate their height. This means their self-reported body mass index (BMI) is known to be lower than it actually is. The data adjusts for this bias by using a formula based on observations from the Health Survey for England over several years, which included both self-reported and clinically-measured BMI figures. Type of data Type of statistic Publisher Publication frequency Purpose of data source These outcomes reflect the focus on how long people live, their life expectancy, and also on how well they live, and their healthy life expectancy. The focus of the data is also on reducing these differences between people and communities from different backgrounds.",1,2,4,4
1,who won the battle of gettysburg union or confederate?,Union,Union,"Breadcrumb Gettysburg Adams County, PA | Jul 1 - 3, 1863 The Battle of Gettysburg marked the turning point of the Civil War. With more than 50,000 estimated casualties, the three-day engagement was the bloodiest single battle of the conflict. How it ended Union victory. Gettysburg ended Confederate general Robert E. Lee's ambitious second quest to invade the North and bring the Civil War to a swift end. The loss there dashed the hopes of the Confederate States of America to become an independent nation. In context After a year of defensive victories in Virginia, Lee's objective was to win a battle north of the Mason-Dixon line in the hopes of forcing a negotiated end to the fighting. His loss at Gettysburg prevented him from realizing that goal. Instead, the defeated general fled south with a wagon train of wounded soldiers straining toward the Potomac. Union general Meade failed to pursue the retreating army, missing a critical opportunity to trap Lee and force a Confederate surrender. The bitterly divisive war raged on for another two years. On June 3, soon after his celebrated victory over Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Gen. Robert E. Lee leads his troops north in his second invasion of enemy territory. The 75,000-man Army of Northern Virginia is in high spirits. In addition to seeking fresh supplies, the depleted soldiers look forward to availing themselves of food from the bountiful fields in Pennsylvania farm country, sustenance the war-ravaged landscape of Virginia can no longer provide. Hooker also heads north, but he is reluctant to engage with Lee directly after the Union's humiliating defeat at Chancellorsville. This evasiveness is of increasing concern to President Abraham Lincoln. Hooker is ultimately relieved of command in late June. His successor, Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, continues to move the 90,000-man Army of the Potomac northward, following orders to keep his army between Lee and Washington, D.C. Meade prepares to defend the routes to the nation's capital, if necessary, but he also pursues Lee. On June 15, three corps of Lee's army cross the Potomac, and by June 28 they reach the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. While Lee loses precious time awaiting intelligence on Union troop positions from his errant cavalry commander, Gen. Jeb Stuart, a spy informs him that Meade is actually very close. Taking advantage of major local roads, which conveniently converge at the county seat, Lee orders his army to Gettysburg. July 1. Early that morning a Confederate division under Maj. Gen. Henry Heth marches toward Gettysburg to seize supplies. In an unplanned engagement, they confront Union cavalry. Brig. Gen. John Buford slows the Confederate advance until the infantry of the Union I and XI Corps under Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds arrives. Reynolds is killed in action. Soon Confederate reinforcements under generals A.P. Hill and Richard Ewell reach the scene. By late afternoon, the wool-clad troops are battling ferociously in the sweltering heat. Thirty thousand Confederates overwhelm 20,000 Federals, who fall back through Gettysburg and fortify Cemetery Hill south of town. July 2. On the second day of battle, the Union defends a fishhook-shaped range of hills and ridges south of Gettysburg. The Confederates wrap around the Union position in a longer line. That afternoon Lee launches a heavy assault commanded by Lieut. Gen. James Longstreet on the Union left flank. Fierce fighting rages at Devil's Den, Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, and Cemetery Ridge as Longstreet's men close in on the Union position. Using their shorter interior lines, Union II Corps commander Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock and others move reinforcements quickly to blunt Confederate advances. On the Federal right, Confederate demonstrations escalate into full-scale assaults on East Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill. Although the Confederates gain ground on both ends of their line, the Union defenders hold strong positions as darkness falls. July 3. Believing his enemy to be weakened, Lee seeks to capitalize on the previous day's gains with renewed attacks on the Union line. Heavy fighting resumes on Culp's Hill as Union troops attempt to recapture ground lost the previous day. Cavalry battles flare to the east and south, but the main event is a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates commanded by Longstreet against the center of the Union position on Cemetery Ridge. Though undermanned, the Virginia infantry division of Brig. Gen. George E. Pickett constitutes about half of the attacking force. During Pickett's Charge, as it is famously known, only one Confederate brigade temporarily reaches the top of the ridge--afterwards referred to as the High Watermark of the Confederacy. This daring strategy ultimately proves a disastrous sacrifice for the Confederates, with casualties approaching 60 percent. Repulsed by close-range Union rifle and artillery fire, the Confederates retreat. When ordered to reform his men after the attack by Lee, Pickett purportedly replied ""I have no divsion"". Lee withdraws his army from Gettysburg late on the rainy afternoon of July 4 and trudges back to Virginia with severely reduced ranks of wasted and battle-scarred men. Union 23,049 3,155 killed 14,529 wounded 5,365 missing & captured Estimated Casualties 51,112 Union 23,049 Confed. 28,063 Confederate 28,063 3,903 killed 18,735 wounded 5,425 missing & captured As many as 51,000 soldiers from both armies are killed, wounded, captured or missing in the three-day battle. The carnage is overwhelming, but the Union victory buoys Lincoln's hopes of ending the war. With Lee running South, Lincoln expects that Meade will intercept the Confederate troops and force their surrender. Meade has no such plan. Even as Lee's escape is hampered by flooding on the Potomac, Meade does not pursue them. When Lincoln learns of this missed opportunity on July 12, he laments, ""We had only to stretch forth our hands & they were ours."" Months later, in November 1863, a portion of the Gettysburg battlefield becomes a final resting place for the Union dead. President Lincoln uses the dedication ceremony at the Gettysburg's Soldiers' National Cemetery to honor the fallen and reassert the purpose of the war in his historic Gettysburg Address: The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 1. What role did enslaved workers play in the Battle of Gettysburg? Between 6,000 and 10,000 enslaved people supported Lee's army as cooks, hospital attendants, blacksmiths, and personal servants to officers. Lee surely knew that some would desert him up north in Gettysburg. In January of that year, Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which gave enslaved people in the Confederate states their freedom. Despite this, many slaves remained loyal to their masters on the battlefield at Gettysburg, and later accompanied them home or carried the effects of those who had died back to their families in the South. Others took advantage of the Union victory to break their bonds and join the opposition. Some black camp workers were taken prisoner along with the Confederate soldiers at Gettysburg and, once released, many stayed in the North. 2. How did the Battle of Gettysburg and its aftermath affect residents of the Pennsylvania town? As Confederates advanced on Gettysburg there was terror among the approximately 2,400 residents there as well as in the neighboring towns. White residents feared for their lives and property; African Americans feared enslavement. Many white civilians huddled in basements, but for people of color the stakes were greater, and they fled. In Gettysburg, Abraham Brian, a free black man who owned a small farm near Cemetery Ridge, left with his family, as did Basil Biggs, a veterinarian, and Owen Robinson, an oyster seller. Nearby in Chambersburg, some contrabands--former slaves who sought refuge with the Union Forces--were kidnapped by Confederate cavalry units. The Emancipation Proclamation stated that those seeking freedom from states of rebellion could not be re-enslaved. Accordingly, the Union refused to hand over contrabands to the Confederates, and this, too, prompted retaliation. Confederate soldiers threatened to burn the homes of white residents who were sheltering contrabands. Often, Confederate troops assumed that free blacks were contrabands solely because of their skin color. After the battle, residents of what had only days before been a peaceful agricultural and college town were in despair. There was literally blood running through the streets, as the dead were piled up in horrific numbers. Slain animals were left to rot. The fields were scorched and barren. Farmers had to rely on the army or government to supply food. Wounded soldiers languished, waiting for medical attention. Camp Letterman, an army field hospital, was established east of Gettysburg and triaged patients until they could be transported to permanent facilities in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington. Nurses for the United States Sanitary Commission, a Union relief organization staffed largely by women, provided essential care and comfort. Residents of Gettysburg managed to bury the dead in a temporary cemetery. However, prominent members of the community lobbied for a permanent burial ground on the battlefield that would honor the defenders of the Union. The Soldiers' National Cemetery was dedicated in November 1863 but was not completed until long after. The last of Gettysburg's wounded shipped out in January 1864, along with the medical personnel. The field tents and temporary shelters came down. The battlefield remains a testament and memorial to the events of July 1-3, 1863. Success! An access link has been emailed to you.

2,what did george washington do as a teenager?,I don't know.,Surveyor,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is a 1997 American slasher film directed by Jim Gillespie and written by Kevin Williamson. It stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze Jr., with supporting roles played by Johnny Galecki, Bridgette Wilson, Anne Heche, and Muse Watson. The first installment in the I Know What You Did Last Summer franchise, it is loosely based on the 1973 novel by Lois Duncan. The film centers on four teenage friends, who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer one year after covering up a car accident in which they supposedly killed a man. It also draws inspiration from the urban legend known as ""the Hook"", as well as the slasher films Prom Night (1980) and The House on Sorority Row (1982). Williamson was approached to adapt Duncan's source novel by producer Erik Feig. Where Scream, released the previous year, contained prominent elements of satire and self-referentiality, Williamson's script for I Know What You Did Last Summer reworked the novel's central plot to resemble a straightforward 1980s-era slasher film. I Know What You Did Last Summer was released theatrically in the United States on October 17, 1997. It received a mixed reception from critics and was a sizeable commercial hit, grossing $125.3 million worldwide on a budget of $17 million, staying in first place at the U.S. box office for three consecutive weeks. The film was parodied in Scary Movie (2000) and is frequently referenced in popular culture, as well as being credited alongside Scream with revitalizing the slasher genre in the 1990s. The film was followed by a sequel, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), in which Hewitt, Prinze Jr., and Watson reprised their roles. A straight-to-video standalone sequel, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (2006), featured an entirely new cast. Following a television series adaptation released by Amazon Prime Video in 2021, a direct legacy sequel to the first two films is scheduled to be released by Sony Pictures on July 18, 2025. == Plot == On July 4, 1996, in Southport, North Carolina, Julie James and her friends Ray Bronson, Helen Shivers, and Barry Cox drive to the beach. On the way back, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie's friend Max passes by them on the road. Barry and Helen try to dump the body in the water, but the pedestrian wakes up and grabs Helen. Barry pushes him into the water and the group swears to never discuss what happened. One year later, Julie returns home from college for the summer. The friends have gone their separate ways, with none of them pursuing their dreams due to struggling with the incident. Julie receives a letter stating, ""I know what you did last summer!"" She and Helen take the note to Barry, who suspects Max. Julie meets Ray, who now works as a fisherman. Max is killed by a figure in a raincoat wielding a hook. That night, Barry is ambushed by the assailant stealing and driving his car. Julie researches newspaper articles, believing that the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen and Julie meet David's sister Missy at her home. Missy explains that a friend of David's named Billy Blue visited her to pay his respects. That night, the killer sneaks into Helen's house and cuts off her hair while she sleeps. The following morning, Julie finds Max's corpse wearing Barry's stolen jacket and covered in crabs in the trunk of her car. When she brings the others to see it, the body has been removed. Julie, Helen and Barry confront Ray, who claims to also have received a letter. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen participate in the 4th of July parade. Missy reveals that David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend, Susie Willis, in a car accident and shows David's suicide note. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie realizes it was not a suicide note, but a death threat. At the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry being m",1,1,1,1
3,what is the name of the capital of belgium?,Brussels,City of Brussels,"News * Early settlement and growth Origins Although the region has been inhabited since prehistoric times, the oldest known reference to Brussels dates to the 10th century, when it had the Frankish name Bruocsella, which means ""settlement in the marshes."" The settlement at that time was a part of Lower Lotharingia, or Lower Lorraine, which later became known as the duchy of Brabant. Brussels owes its development to its location on the Senne (Flemish: Zenne) River, which flows from south to north, and an east-west economic route linking towns on the Rhine, such as Cologne (now in Germany), with Brugge (French: Bruges), Ieper (French: Ypres), and other towns in the county of Flanders. At the point where road and river crossed, a market and bartering place developed under the protection of the dukes of Brabant. By the 12th century, Brussels was surrounded by defensive ramparts with towers and fortified gateways. During the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries, Brussels grew to become one of the major towns of the duchy of Brabant. Its economic mainstay was the manufacture of luxury fabrics, which were exported to fairs in Paris, Venice, the Champagne region of France, and elsewhere. The cloth trade made fortunes for a few enterprising merchant families, who developed into seven dynasties that, with the help of the duke of Brabant, acquired a position of complete political mastery. In control of business and municipal affairs, they also exercised power as magistrates, giving rulings on disputes arising among the inhabitants, as well as acting as a court of appeal for neighbouring areas. The prevailing regime was, in fact, strongly plutocratic in nature. Abuse of such powers provoked violent popular uprisings in 1280, 1303, 1360, and 1421. This last upheaval led to a more equitable system of government, with local powers divided between the patrician families and the emergent guilds of craftsmen and other workers. Gradually, however, the patrician elite regained political control; as late as 1719 a popular revolt led by Frans Anneessens ended with his public execution. Centuries of occupation Events of particular significance in the 14th century were the invasion of the duchy of Brabant by troops of the count of Flanders, their brief occupation of Brussels, and the construction--immediately after the town's liberation--of huge fortified walls (1357-79), which survived until the first half of the 19th century. In 1430 the duchy was merged with the possessions of the duke of Burgundy. The Burgundian period, which lasted until 1477, was one of political and artistic prestige. Brussels became the seat of the central administrative bodies for the ducal possessions in the Low Countries, which constituted a rich centre of art and culture. Pictures by Rogier van der Weyden (the officially appointed town painter), sculptures in wood, large tapestries with historical motifs, plate, jewelry, and other products by Brussels craftsmen came to be exported in all directions. Brussels began to beautify itself: near the marketplace, the Town Hall (1402-54) rose proudly, with its tall perforated steeple surmounted by a statue of the archangel Michael, the city's patron saint. Various Gothic churches and cathedrals and the ducal Coudenberg Palace (destroyed in the 18th century), with its extensive park, added to the architectural splendour. After a prolonged political crisis caused by an abortive rebellion against the future Holy Roman emperorMaximilian I at the end of the 15th century, Brussels regained its position as a capital during the reign of Charles V (1519-56), who as Holy Roman emperor and king of Spain ruled a vast empire that included the Low Countries. Charles's three government councils (the Council of State, the Privy Council, and the Finance Council) were established permanently in Brussels, and the city's population grew to nearly 50,000 by the mid-16th century. In 1561 a canal linking Brussels with Willebroek was dug, providing direct access to the Rupel and the Schelde rivers and thus to the port of Antwerp and the North Sea. Replacing the sandy little Senne River, the Willebroek Canal played an important commercial role. The Reformation did not leave Brussels untouched. Two Lutheran preachers, the first Protestant martyrs in the Low Countries, died there at the stake in 1523, and many more Lutherans, Anabaptists, and Calvinists followed. During the revolt of the Low Countries against their Spanish Habsburg rulers (seeEighty Years' War), Brussels was under Calvinist rule from 1578 until 1585. By the latter date, however, the southern provinces of the Low Countries (which included modern-day Belgium) had separated from the northern provinces (now the Kingdom of the Netherlands), surrendered to the Spanish Habsburgs, and returned to the Roman Catholic fold. Brussels thus remained part of the Spanish-held southern provinces, or Spanish Netherlands, into the 18th century. The Counter-Reformation and the reign of Archduke Albert VII and Isabella (1598-1633) left their mark on the urban surroundings with the construction of a series of fine churches in the Italo-Flemish Baroque style, nearly all of which are still in existence. In the second half of the 17th century, there were repeated invasions by the armies of Louis XIV of France. During a bombardment by his troops in 1695, hundreds of buildings were destroyed by fire, including the various craft headquarters. Out of this catastrophe there arose new guildhalls, the architectural landmarks now surrounding the Grand' Place (Grote Markt). With control of the Spanish Netherlands passing to the Austrian Habsburgs in 1713, Brussels became part of the Austrian Netherlands. Under Austrian rule the city suffered a brief but costly occupation by French troops in 1746-48 but profited from the general economic recovery in the latter half of the 18th century, becoming a financial centre and gaining new industries. The upper part of the town was the scene of urban planning on a large scale, which resulted in the Place Royale and Brussels Park. Following the Brabant Revolution (1789-90) against the government of Holy Roman emperor Joseph II, the French republican armies made their appearance, and the Belgian principalities were annexed to France. During the Napoleonic era, Brussels was reduced to the rank of chief town of the French departement of the Dyle, losing in addition all authority over its satellite villages. (SeeFrench revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.) One of the consequences of Napoleon I's defeat at Waterloo (1815) was the creation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This reunion of the southern and northern provinces, which had been separated in the 16th century, lasted 15 years (1815-30). During this period Brussels shared the status of capital with The Hague. Its appearance changed appreciably, above all because of the demolition of the city walls (1810-40) and their replacement by tree-lined boulevards, as well as the digging of the Brussels-Charleroi Canal, which from 1832 onward made waterborne transport possible from as far as the province of Hainaut to the port of Antwerp via the capital. In 1830 came revolution; Belgium won its independence, and, in the constitution adopted by the newly elected National Congress, Brussels, which had played a major role in the uprising against the Kingdom of the Netherlands, was named the capital of Belgium and the seat of government. The Brussels elite remained predominant in Belgian national politics throughout the 19th century. Meanwhile, the city's growing political and administrative role enhanced its importance as an economic and financial centre. With a population of more than 123,000 in 1846, it became the central node of Belgium's road and railway network. Its material infrastructure was greatly improved by means of a modern sewerage and water-supply system, the introduction of public transport, and the development of new residential districts. However, as suburban areas were incorporated into the agglomeration, the fragmented local administration was streamlined only partly and gradually.

News * Brussels, city, capital of Belgium. It is located in the valley of the Senne (Flemish: Zenne) River, a small tributary of the Schelde (French: Escaut). Greater Brussels is the country's largest urban agglomeration. It consists of 19 communes, or municipalities, each with a large measure of administrative autonomy. The largest commune--which, like the greater metropolitan area, is named Brussels--contains the historic core of the city and the so-called ""European Quarter,"" where the institutions of the European Union (EU) are located. Greater Brussels officially became the Brussels-Capital Region in 1989, during the federalization of Belgium. Along with the much larger regions of Flanders and Wallonia, the Brussels-Capital Region constitutes one of the country's three main political divisions. As the seat of the EU, Brussels is known as the ""capital of Europe,"" and its significance as a centre of international governance and business makes Brussels a true global city--a status shared with such metropolises as New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo. Area Brussels-Capital Region, 62 square miles (161 square km). Pop. (2022 est.) Brussels-Capital Region, 1,222,637; Brussels commune, 188,737. Brussels is the administrative, commercial, and financial heart of Belgium, and the majority of services and institutions of national importance are based in the city. Brussels is, in addition, a major European tourist and cultural attraction, functioning simultaneously as a regional metropolis and an international centre. The last-named role has flourished since the city became host to the European Communities (ultimately succeeded by the EU) as well as to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) headquarters. The city lies just a few miles north of the invisible ""language boundary"" separating Belgium's Flemish-speaking region of Flanders in the north from the southern, French-speaking Walloon Region. Brussels is thus surrounded by Flemish territory. Although historically it was a predominantly Flemish-speaking city, at present the majority of residents in the Brussels agglomeration speak French, which is also the preferred language of the city's growing international labour force. The city is bilingual, and in all spheres of public life Flemish and French are used side by side. Nevertheless, in the 20th century Brussels became the principal venue for political and cultural clashes between Flemings and Walloons. Partly as a result of these conflicts, the Belgian parliament reorganized the country's structure on the basis of the Flemish, Walloon, and Brussels-Capital regions. Although the Brussels-Capital Region maintains a separate political identity, the city of Brussels also functions as the capital of the Flemish Region and as the capital of the country's French- and Flemish-language communities. Although the average visitor to Brussels might remain unaware of the various governmental powers vested there, the interdigitation of municipal, national, and European politics has contributed to many of the city's problems. It has, for example, impeded the harmonious development of the city's spreading built-up areas as well as its public transportationinfrastructure, already hindered by an automobile-friendly street plan. Moreover, national and transnational interests have at times taken precedence over the interests of local residents. There is no question that Brussels is a polarized place. Dilapidated neighbourhoods in the centre-west and west stand in stark contrast to manicured lawns, restored townhouses, and posh suburban villas in the east and southeast. Dated industrial infrastructure lies a few miles from the astringent glass-and-steel administrative district of the EU. Yet, its urban pathologies aside, Brussels is not a city in decay but a place of great vibrancy and multicultural depth--a much more exciting and cosmopolitan place than it ever was during its centuries-long history. Landscape City site Brussels lies in the Central Plateaus of Belgium. Located between the Atlantic oceanfront of sandy lowlands and polders to the north and the rugged Ardennes highlands to the south, Brussels has long played the role of economic and transportation nexus for the broader region that spans the valleys of the Schelde, Sambre, and Meuse rivers. During the medieval period, Brussels was enclosed by two successive circuits of fortification walls, constructed in the 11th and 14th centuries. The latter circuit, which encompassed the commercially important Senne and a significant escarpment to the east, was roughly in the shape of a pentagon, the trace of which is still visible from the air. Over time, villages surrounding the pentagon were aggregated, and, together with historic central Brussels, they ultimately constituted Greater Brussels. Today, the metropolitan area of Brussels, girded by a beltway (the so-called grande ceinture), extends beyond the footprint of the 19 communes to encompass a fringe of the province of Flemish Brabant. Climate Its relative proximity to the North Sea gives Brussels a mild maritime climate, with summer daytime temperatures usually between 68 and 77 degF (20 and 25 degC) and winter temperatures rarely dipping below 32 degF (0 degC). With rain falling on more than half the days of the year on average, Brussels experiences a high mean annual precipitation (more than 32 inches [810 mm]) and has no discernible dry season. Snowfall rarely occurs more than two or three times a year. As Brussels is distinctly automobile friendly, noise and air pollution are notable problems.

About this Item Title Other Title Summary This late-18th century French map shows Brussels, at that time an important city in the Spanish Netherlands and the capital of the Duchy of Brabant. The map shows the borders of the city and the Senne River. The location of the city on the river made it an important commercial center for trade between France and the Germanic states. In 1695, Brussels was attacked by the army of Louis XIV, and suffered heavy damage. It remained under siege off and on until it was captured by the French in 1746. Brussels became the capital of Belgium when it became an independent country in 1830, and in 1958 was made the seat of the European Economic Community, the precursor to today's European Union.

4,who does darth vaders voice?,James Earl Jones,James Earl Jones,"Darth Vader () is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He was first introduced in the original film trilogy as one of the leaders of the Galactic Empire. The prequel trilogy chronicles his transformation from the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. His metamorphosis begins when he is lured to the dark side of the Force by Chancellor Palpatine, who later becomes the Emperor. After a lightsaber battle with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader is severely injured and is transformed into a cyborg. He serves Palpatine for over two decades, hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel Alliance. When Palpatine tries to kill Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, the Sith Lord turns against his master and destroys him. Vader is the husband of Padmé Amidala, the father of Luke and his twin sister Leia Organa, and the grandfather of Ben Solo (later known as Kylo Ren). David Prowse physically portrays Vader in the original trilogy, while James Earl Jones provides his voice in all of the films and some television series. Sebastian Shaw portrays Anakin in Return of the Jedi (1983), while Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen portray Anakin in the prequel trilogy, with Christensen reprising the role in the series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and Ahsoka (2023). In the standalone film Rogue One (2016), Vader is portrayed by Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous. The character also appears in novels, comics, and video games. He has become an iconic villain of cinema. == Creation and development == === Darth Vader === As part of the development for the original Star Wars film, George Lucas hired the artist Ralph McQuarrie to create conceptual images for the characters. For Vader, Lucas asked McQuarrie to depict a ""very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind."" Because the script described Vader traveling between spaceships, McQuarrie suggested that he should wear a space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie created Vader's iconic mask by combining a full-face breathing mask with a samurai helmet. A 1975 production painting by McQuarrie depicts Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller, who later became Luke Skywalker. Vader is shown wearing black armor, a flowing cape and a skull-like mask and helmet. This early design was similar to Vader's final appearance. Working from McQuarrie's concepts, the costume designer John Mollo devised an outfit that combined clerical robes, a motorcycle suit, a German military helmet, and a military gas mask. The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armor. The sound of Vader's breathing was created by the film's sound designer, Ben Burtt, using modified recordings of a scuba breathing apparatus. The sound effect is trademarked at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Lucas has provided differing accounts of how the name ""Darth Vader"" originated. In a 2005 interview with Rolling Stone, he claimed it was a modified version of ""Dark Father."" On another occasion, he said it was inspired by the phrase ""Dark Water"". It is also possible that ""Darth Vader"" originated from the name of Gary Vader, a boy who went to high school with Lucas. The names of various Star Wars characters have been altered in countries outside the United States. In France, Vader's name was changed to Dark Vador (pronounced [daʁk vadɔʁ]) starting with the original film. Although the names of some other characters have been reverted to the English versions over the years, Vader is still referred to as Dark Vador in recent French-language Star Wars media. The title ""Darth"" has been replaced with ""Dark"" for other Sith Lords as well. In Italian-language editions of Star Wars films, Darth Vader was called Dart Fener (pronounced [ˌdar(t) ˈfɛːner]) starting with the original trilogy. In 2004, the dubbing director for the Italian-language version of Revenge of the Sith (2005) asked Italian fans to decide which name to use in the film; the Italian name

David Charles Prowse (1 July 1935 – 28 November 2020) was an English actor, bodybuilder, strongman and weightlifter. He portrayed Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy and a manservant in Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange. In 2015, he starred in two documentaries concerning his Darth Vader role, one titled The Force's Mouth, which included Prowse voicing Darth Vader's lines with studio effects applied for the first time, and the other titled I Am Your Father, covering the subject of the fallout between Prowse and Lucasfilm. Prior to his role as Vader, Prowse had established himself as a super-hero figure in the United Kingdom as the Green Cross Man in Green Cross Code media aimed at teaching children and young people road safety. == Early life == David Charles Prowse was born on 1 July 1935 in Bristol, England. He was the son of Gladys (née Burt) and Charles Prowse. He was brought up on the Southmead housing estate in Bristol, gaining a scholarship to Bristol Grammar School. Prowse was tall, standing 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), and developed an interest in bodybuilding. His early jobs included a bouncer at a dance hall, where he met his future wife, at Henleaze Swimming Pool. Following his successes from 1961 in the British heavyweight weightlifting championship, he left Bristol in 1963 to work for a London weightlifting company. == Career == === Weightlifting and training === Prowse won the British heavyweight weightlifting championship in 1962. The following two years he represented England in the weightlifting event at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia. During his bodybuilding course, Prowse became friends with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno. Prowse could deadlift as much as 784 lb (356 kg) and was notable for being the first person to lift the Dinnie Stones. During his prime, Prowse weighed around 282 pounds (128 kg). During the 1970s, Prowse developed a minor interest with wrestling and trained many British wrestlers of the time. Prowse helped to train Christopher Reeve for the lead role in Superman (1978) after lobbying for the part himself. In a television interview, he related how his response to being told ""we've found our Superman"" was ""Thank you very much."" Only then was he told that Reeve had been chosen for the role and he was to only be a trainer. He trained Cary Elwes for his role as Westley in The Princess Bride (1987). Prowse also became fitness consultant to Harrods, ripped up phone books under the stage name 'Jack the Ripper', and opened a series of gyms, including The Dave Prowse Fitness Centre in Southwark, London. Notably, Arnold Schwarzenegger sometimes trained at Prowse's gym and the British bodybuilder was also a judge at the last Mr. Universe contest Schwarzenegger won. After making his last professional film appearance as Vader in 1983, he returned his major focus on weightlifting and continued to appear on some strength demonstrations in the United Kingdom until the late 1990s. === Acting === His first appearance is a brief cameo in a gym as a weightlifter in the 1968 TV show The Champions: the opening sequence of episode 2 ""The Invisible Man"". Also in 1968, he was cast as kilt wearing and bagpipe playing Emlyn MacGregor in The Beverly Hillbillies episode ""Coming Through the Rye"" (season 7 episode 4). He made an appearance as henchman Tony in the 1969 TV show The Saint (series 6 episode 20) starring Roger Moore. In the United Kingdom, Prowse was well known as the Green Cross Man, a superhero invented to promote a road safety campaign for children in 1975. As a result of his association with the campaign, which ran between 1971 and 1990, he received the MBE in 2000. He had a role as Frank Alexander's manservant, Julian, in the film A Clockwork Orange (1971), in which he was noticed by the future Star Wars director George Lucas. He played a circus strongman in Vampire Circus (1972), a Minotaur in the Doctor Who serial The Time Mon",5,1,5,5

Using veterans to smash political opposition, he seized power in October 1922. World War I rescued Socialist revolutionary Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) from frustration. Editor of the Milan-based Italian Socialist newspaperAvanti! from November 1913, he realized bourgeois party leaders rejected revolution. He watched army, police and nationalist vigilantes crush worker revolt during the ""Red Week"" of June 1914. That July, he witnessed the Second International failure to stop European war, then division along national lines. Italy remained neutral. In mid-September, Mussolini told the Avanti! staff that war alone could bring Italian revolution. After his late October editorial demanded Italian intervention, Socialist outrage prompted Mussolini's resignation. When his pro-interventionist newspaper, Il Popolo d'Italia, appeared in mid-November, the party expelled him. Mussolini concealed its funding by industrialists, the French, his wealthy lover Margherita Sarfatti (1880-1961) and possibly Russian agents. For six months, through editorials and demonstrations, he promoted the Interventionist movement, collaborating with Syndicalist Filippo Corridoni (1887-1915). Mussolini demanded war against Italy's allies, Germany and Austria-Hungary, to demolish bulwarks against European revolution. A victorious war would forge a national mass movement demanding political change. If the government rejected war, Mussolini threatened revolution. Most Italians favored peace, but Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy (1869-1947) forced a war declaration on 24 May 1915. Mussolini received generous leave time for medical and political reasons. It seems likely that the king and government knew, or at least suspected, that Mussolini was syphilitic.1 Nevertheless, they were still content that Mussolini, a militant Interventionist in the trenches, would continue to direct Il Popolo d'Italia. In Mussolini's early war diary excerpts published in Il Popolo d'Italia, he depicted himself as a Nietzschean Ubermensch among submissive comrades. However, Mussolini's health and spirit gradually declined. He escaped the Isonzo Battles and the mid-1916 Trentino operations. Nonetheless, he endured miserable attrition warfare in the badly led, poorly equipped Italian army. Unlike Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), he enjoyed neither army life nor war. In late 1916, Mussolini's unit moved to the dangerous Carso plateau. The 33-year-old Mussolini's unpublished diary entries reveal his increasing demoralization, remorse over interventionism, even despair. He implored Leonida Bissolati (1857-1920), an ex-reform Socialist and minister-without-portfolio, to arrange his release from service. That effort failed. But a late February 1917 training explosion caused Sergeant Mussolini's medical evacuation. Although lightly injured, he remained hospitalized until August. Mussolini required recuperation from right tibia surgery to remove syphilitic tumors. He received one year's convalescent leave, extended for six months, resuming resident editorship of Il Popolo d'Italia. Following the October 1917 Italian defeat at Caporetto, the British Secret Service paid Mussolini 100 pounds weekly to support his pro-war newspaper and organize veterans' attacks on peace demonstrations. In January 1918, Margherita Sarfatti's son Roberto (1900-1918) died in combat. Mussolini exalted him and Corridoni as symbols of youthful sacrifice demanding struggle until victory. Afterward, their comrades, ""the aristocracy of the trenches,"" would transform Italy. Weeks after the armistice, Mussolini briefly visited Berlin. Revolutionary German veterans dominated the capital, reinforcing Mussolini's vision of Italian soldiers, returning home to become a militant political force. Unlike radicalized workers, their protests would express wounded patriotism and righteous indignation against weak bourgeois government and socialist anti-militarism. The war had been only the first stage of revolution. Mussolini inaugurated his Fascist movement on 23 March 1919 before an audience including veterans (some from the black-shirted assault troops, the Arditi), Futurists, ex-Socialists, Syndicalists and Interventionists. He advocated a republic devoted to class cooperation. A national assembly of corporations would represent economic groups, promoting cooperation among workers, managers and capitalists, as well as among farm workers, overseers and land owners. Society would be organized into units like an army. Mussolini's followers formed a few Fasci di combattimento (""Combat groups"") to battle resurgent postwar Socialism. They adopted the black shirts of the Arditi as uniforms. But a platform fusing revolutionary Socialism, Syndicalism, republicanism, extreme nationalism and imperialism brought the Fascists only 4,800 votes in the November 1919 parliamentary elections. Seventeen months passed before the violence of the 1919-1920 biennio rosso (""The Two Red Years"") revived Mussolini's movement. The army and police proved unequal to peasant and worker strikes and unrest. Coalescing around a core of ex-officers and NCOs, the Fasci multiplied, bringing government forces welcome reinforcement.

Salandra was educated in law and taught public administration at the University of Rome before entering politics. A member of a wealthy family and a conservative, he rose to become minister of agriculture in 1899 and finance minister in 1906 and again in 1909-10. He became premier in March 1914 and so was confronted with a critical decision on the outbreak of World War I in July. Despite the generation-old Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, Salandra chose neutrality, taking for legal ground the failure of the Austrians to consult the Italian government before their attack on Serbia. Salandra then used Italy's strong position to bargain with both sides, at length bringing his country into the war on the side of the Allies in May 1915 on the basis of definite promises of the completion of Italian unification by acquisition of territory from Austria-Hungary. In 1916 Salandra was forced to resign as a result of Italy's growing military difficulties. After the war his authoritarianconservatism led him to support Benito Mussolini and fascism, but, when the extreme course of the new regime became clear, he modified his support. Nevertheless, Mussolini made him a senator in 1928.

How did Benito Mussolini rise to power? While working for various labour organizations in Switzerland, Benito Mussolini made a name for himself as a charismatic personality and a consummate rhetorician. After returning to Italy, he amassed a large following while working as an editor for the socialist magazine Avanti!. His political beliefs took a hairpin turn to the right midway through World War I, when he stopped decrying the war effort and began advocating for it. After World War I he began organizing fasci di combattimento--nationalist paramilitary forces known for wearing black shirts. These groups began waging campaigns of terrorism and intimidation against Italy's leftist institutions at his behest. In 1922 Mussolini and other fascist leaders organized a march on Rome with the intention of forcing the king to yield the government to Mussolini. It worked, and Mussolini was appointed prime minister that same year. By 1925 Mussolini had dismantled Italy's democratic institutions and assumed his role as dictator, adopting the title Il Duce (""The Leader""). What were Benito Mussolini's political beliefs? Benito Mussolini was Europe's first 20th-century fascist dictator. But Mussolini's political orientation didn't always lean that way. His father was an ardent socialist who worked part-time as a journalist for leftist publications. In his initial overtures into politics, Mussolini's beliefs took after his father's: he spent time organizing with trade unions and writing for socialist publications in both Switzerland and Italy. Mussolini's politics took a turn to the right midway through World War I, when he became a proponent for the war effort. It was during this period, and after, that the nationalist and anti-Bolshevik strands of thought that would characterize his later politics began to emerge. These politics included the themes of racial superiority, xenophobia, and imperialism that defined his actions as a dictator. Where did the word fascism come from? Benito Mussolini was Europe's first 20th-century fascist dictator, and the word fascism comes from the far-right movement he led in Italy. Mussolini named the fasci di combattimento--paramilitary groups which were largely under his control and from which his movement derived its own name, fascismo--after the Latin word fasces, which was the bundle of wooden sticks topped with an axe-head that ancient Roman authority figures' attendants would carry to distinguish their rank. What was Benito Mussolini's role in World War II? Benito Mussolini was the less dominant half of the Rome-Berlin axis, formalized by the 1939 Pact of Steel between Adolf Hitler and himself. World War II broke out between Germany and the rest of Europe later that year, but Italy--its resources already stretched thin by preexisting economic issues and Mussolini's Ethiopian conquest in 1935--was hesitant to join. Anxious that he would lose claim to conquered European lands as Hitler advanced, Mussolini entered the war in 1940. Italy fared poorly from the outset, with ignominious defeats in North Africa, Greece, and the Soviet Union. When the Allies touched down in Sicily in 1943, Mussolini's own government arrested him. What was Benito Mussolini's personal life like? Benito Mussolini was born to a poor family in Predappio, a town in northeastern Italy. His father was a blacksmith who wrote part-time as a socialist journalist, and his mother was a staunchly Catholic schoolteacher. As an adult, Benito Mussolini would have two wives and many mistresses. He had one child with his first wife, Ida Dalser, but would eventually abandon them and seek to hide them from the public eye. He would have five children--three boys and two girls--by another wife, Rachele Guidi. It was alongside his longtime mistress, Clara Petacci, that he died, however. The two were executed in 1943 by Italian partisans as they tried to escape to Switzerland, and their bodies were hung upside down in Milan. Early life Mussolini was the first child of the local blacksmith. In later years he expressed pride in his humble origins and often spoke of himself as a ""man of the people."" The Mussolini family was, in fact, less humble than he claimed--his father, a part-time socialist journalist as well as a blacksmith, was the son of a lieutenant in the National Guard, and his mother was a schoolteacher--but the Mussolinis were certainly poor. They lived in two crowded rooms on the second floor of a small, decrepit palazzo; and, because Mussolini's father spent much of his time discussing politics in taverns and most of his money on his mistress, the meals that his three children ate were often meagre. A restless child, Mussolini was disobedient, unruly, and aggressive. He was a bully at school and moody at home. Because the teachers at the village school could not control him, he was sent to board with the strict Salesian order at Faenza, where he proved himself more troublesome than ever, stabbing a fellow pupil with a penknife and attacking one of the Salesians who had attempted to beat him. He was expelled and sent to the Giosue Carducci School at Forlimpopoli, from which he was also expelled after assaulting yet another pupil with his penknife. He was also intelligent, and he passed his final examinations without difficulty. He obtained a teaching diploma and for a time worked as a schoolmaster but soon realized that he was totally unsuited for such work. At the age of 19, a short, pale young man with a powerful jaw and enormous, dark, piercing eyes, he left Italy for Switzerland with a nickel medallion of Karl Marx in his otherwise empty pockets. For the next few months, according to his own account, he lived from day to day, jumping from job to job. At the same time, however, he was gaining a reputation as a young man of strange magnetism and remarkable rhetorical talents. He read widely and voraciously, if not deeply, plunging into the philosophers and theorists Immanuel Kant, Benedict de Spinoza, Peter Kropotkin, Friedrich Nietzsche, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Kautsky, and Georges Sorel, picking out what appealed to him and discarding the rest, forming no coherent political philosophy of his own yet impressing his companions as a potential revolutionary of uncommon personality and striking presence. While earning a reputation as a political journalist and public speaker, he produced propaganda for a trade union, proposing a strike and advocating violence as a means of enforcing demands. Repeatedly, he called for a day of vengeance. More than once he was arrested and imprisoned. When he returned to Italy in 1904, even the Roman newspapers had started to mention his name. For some time after his return little was heard of him. He once more became a schoolmaster, this time in the Venetian Alps, north of Udine, where he lived, so he confessed, a life of ""moral deterioration."" But soon tiring of so wasteful a life, he returned to trade-union work, to journalism, and to extreme politics, which led yet again to arrest and imprisonment. During a period of freedom in 1909, he fell in love with 16-year-old Rachele Guidi, the younger of the two daughters of his father's widowed mistress; she went to live with him in a damp, cramped apartment in Forli and later married him. Soon after the marriage, Mussolini was imprisoned for the fifth time; but by then Comrade Mussolini had become recognized as one of the most gifted and dangerous of Italy's younger socialists. After writing in a wide variety of socialist papers, he founded a newspaper of his own, La Lotta di Classe (""The Class Struggle""). So successful was this paper that in 1912 he was appointed editor of the official Socialist newspaper, Avanti! (""Forward!""), whose circulation he soon doubled; and as its antimilitarist, antinationalist, and anti-imperialist editor, he thunderously opposed Italy's intervention in World War I. Soon, however, he changed his mind about intervention. Swayed by Karl Marx's aphorism that social revolution usually follows war and persuaded that ""the defeat of France would be a deathblow to liberty in Europe,"" he began writing articles and making speeches as violently in favour of war as those in which he previously had condemned it. He resigned from Avanti! and was expelled from the Socialist Party. Financed by the French government and Italian industrialists, both of whom favoured war against Austria, he assumed the editorship of Il Popolo d'Italia (""The People of Italy""), in which he unequivocally stated his new philosophy: ""From today onward we are all Italians and nothing but Italians. Now that steel has met steel, one single cry comes from our hearts--Viva l'Italia! [Long live Italy!]"" It was the birth cry of fascism. Mussolini went to fight in the war.",1,1,1,5
6,where is harley davidson corporate headquarters?,Juneau Avenue,Milwaukee,"The Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Factory Building was the original Harley-Davidson motorcycle factory constructed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1906. The factory was located at what is now 3700 W. Juneau and it was regularly expanded with additions in the early 1900s. It was added to National Register of Historic Places on November 9, 1994. == Background == Harley-Davidson's first location was a backyard shed where William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson built three motorcycles in 1903. Arthur Davidson's father was a cabinet maker and he constructed the shed in the Davidson backyard: it was 10 ft × 15 ft (3.0 m × 4.6 m). In 1904 the shed size was doubled with an addition and the fledgling company produced 8 motorcycles. In 1905 the shed size was doubled again with another addition. By the end of 1905 Harley and Davidson applied for and received a loan to build a factory. They purchased land at what is now Juneau Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and began constructing the 1906 Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Factory Building. In 1906, Harley and the Davidson brothers built their first factory on Chestnut Street (later Juneau Avenue). The first Juneau Avenue plant was 28 ft × 80 ft (8.5 m × 24.4 m). == Design == The original factory was at the current location of Harley-Davidson's corporate headquarters. In 1906 the company produced 50 machines in their new factory. The building was continually expanded to meet the demand with construction occurring often. The company also rented factory space in other Milwaukee locations. The demand for Harley-Davidson motorcycles was growing each year: In 1909 they produced 1,149, motorcycles, in 1911 5,625, in 1912 3,852, in 1913 12,966. Motorcycles were produced at the original location from 1903 to 1973. By 1909 the machine shop occupied 5,760 sq ft (535 m2). The building was considered modern in 1909 but by 1913 it was inadequate based on the increased demand for Harley-Davidsons. The company razed the structure from April 17 to 23, 1913, and began building a larger factory which would be open by June 1913. In 1913 Motorcycle Illustrated published an article on Harley-Davidson constructing their 8th building on the property. It was a 6-story structure with 40,320 sq ft (3,746 m2) of floor space designated for the machine shop and the building was 90 ft × 64 ft (27 m × 20 m). The structure was built at a cost of US$100,000. The original 1906 Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Factory Building site was added to the Wisconsin Historical Society Register of Historic Places on January 1, 1989, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 9, 1994. == References ==",1,1,1,5
7,where did francisco coronado come from?,Spain,Salamanca,"Francisco Coronado A photograph of a painting from the Deaf Smith County Museum in Hereford, TX. (Credit: Billy Hathorn) Introduction Francisco Coronado was a Spanish governor in what is modern day Mexico who went on to explore the southwest United States. His expedition was one that was prompted by stories of myth and riches. He was looking for the fabled Seven Cities of Gold. This journey took him into new areas not yet previously explored by Europeans. His travels went from present day Mexico, into parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and up to present-day Kansas. He did not find this fabled city of riches. But he and his men found something else that people from far and wide come to see even still today - the Grand Canyon. Biography Early Life Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was born in Salamanca, Spain in 1510. Although his family name was Vasquez, the English do not follow the same naming system. So overtime, he became known just as Francisco Coronado.1 He was the second son of Juan Vasquez de Coronado and his wife Isabel de Lujan. They were a family of nobility and they owned a large estate.2 Not very much is known of Coronado's early life. But because of his family's status, young Francisco would have received a pretty good education. In these days, the eldest son would inherit his parent's status and money. Since Francisco was the second son, he would be expected to work and make his own fortune. Juan Coronado worked for a man named Inigo Lopez de Mendoza, the governor of Granada, Spain. Inigo had a son named Antonio, with whom Francisco became friends with. This friendship would lead Coronado to new and great opportunities. During this period, several Spanish conquistadors had invaded many parts of the New World, and began setting up colonies. The Spanish empire named the territory New Spain - today the area is called Mexico. In April 1535, Antonio de Mendoza was made viceroy - someone who is appointed to rule a colony - of New Spain.3 Mendoza asked Coronado to join him, and work as his assistant. While in New Spain, Coronado married Beatriz de Estrada, who came from a wealthy family. Once married, Coronado inherited half of her wealth.4 Coronado became an important military commander helping to settle arguments between the natives and the Spaniards. In 1538, he was made governor of New Galicia, a province in western Mexico. Coronado was now wealthy, respected, and a leader in the New World. Mendoza and Coronado had heard stories from another Spanish explorer named Cabeza de Vaca, about a place known as the Seven Golden Cities of Cibola. It was believed that these Native American cities were filled with riches. So Mendoza chose Coronado to lead an expedition, find and explore these cities, and conquer the area and treasures in the name of Spain. Voyages Principal Voyage Francisco Coronado began his expedition in February 1540.5 He had about 300 Spanish soldiers, several hundred natives, and herds of horses, cattle, and other livestock. They were traveling to lands northeast of New Galicia. This area had yet to be explored by the Spanish, even though they controlled much of the land. They began by heading north, along the West Coast of Mexico. They then went through Culiacan, the Yaqui River, and crossed the mountains into present day Southeast Arizona.6 In July 1540, Coronado and his men came upon what they thought was their first discovery of the golden cities of Cibola. What they actually came upon was the Native American pueblos of present day New Mexico Zuni tribe.7 Pueblo is Spanish for ""village"" or ""town."" Pueblos were a group of homes lived in by Native Americans, especially the Pueblo people. Coronado came in and conquered the town of Hawikuh where he set up camp. Cibola fell short of Coronado's expectations. There were none of the gold or other riches he had expected to find. In the fall of 1540, they moved their base to the Rio Grande in what is now central New Mexico.8 Coronado soon sent out two scouting parties. One party, led by Garcia Lopez de Cardenas, became the first Europeans to discover the Grand Canyon. The other party found more pueblos in the Rio Grande Valley. In the Tiguex area (near modern day Albuquerque and Bernalillo, New Mexico) they began a battle agains the Pueblo natives. This battle lasted several months before it ended. After his men re-joined Coronado, they settled in for winter near what is now present day Santa Fe, New Mexico. Coronado was still disappointed that he had found no treasures. But his hope was restored in 1541 when he heard stories of a new land filled with riches. Subsequent Voyages After winter ended, Coronado was ready for the second part of his expedition. One of the native slaves had told Coronado of a new land to the northeast. The capital of this land, called Quivira, was said to be very rich. In April 1541, Coronado and his army marched toward Quivira. They crossed the Pecos river and Palo Duro Canyon. They soon arrived at the Great Plains where they saw herds of buffalo.9 They continued across the Northwest part of present day Texas and Oklahoma, and finally arrived at Quivira in present day Kansas. Coronado spent about a month exploring. They found a village of the Wichita Native American tribe, but found none of the riches his slave had told him. The slave confessed that he made up the story, so Coronado had him executed.10 Coronado returned to Cibola, where he spent another winter. After winter passed, they began their journey back to Mexico. Later Years and Death In the fall of 1542, Francisco Coronado and about 100 of his men returned to New Galicia. His mission had been unsuccessful. In 1544, Mendoza, disappointed with Coronado's failure, had him removed as governor. Coronado went to Mexico city, where he lived a quiet life as a councilman. He died on September 22, 1554. Legacy Although Francisco Coronado's journey was seen as a failure in his lifetime, he is recognized today for many achievements. He claimed many parts of land for Spain. He and his men are also the first Europeans to live among the Pueblo Indians, explore the Great Plains, and see the Grand Canyon.11 His description of the areas he explored helped create updated maps of the lands. Coronado's explorations helped open up the southwestern United States for future Spanish colonization. Images A photograph of a painting from the Deaf Smith County Museum in Hereford, TX.

8,what was the ancient chinese writing system?,oracle bone script,Sino-Tibetan languages,"The Birth of Writing in China The earliest examples of writing date to 7,000 BCE when Neolithic Period humans in China and elsewhere began producing glyphs and ideographics--symbols representing objects and ideas. Markings which some archaeologists have identified as examples of proto-writing first appeared in China in approximately 6600 BCE, evidence of which has been discovered at the Jiahu archaeological site in Henan, China. Pictograms have also been found in China dating from the 5th century BCE. Despite these very early examples of proto-writing, it was not until 1400 BCE that a near-complete writing system was developed in China. This Shang Dynasty script, known as the oracle bone script because of its appearance on bones used for divining, appeared in a nearly complete form with no clear developmental history. Whether the archaeological record is incomplete or the script was borrowed in part from Middle Eastern source--rather than developed wholly in China--is unclear. Regardless, the appearance of this near-complete writing was a significant technological advance for the Chinese people and gave birth to a literate and highly published population.1 Since the appearance of the oracle bone script, Chinese writing has undergone a number of fundamental changes, including the use of compound characters for clarity and alterations in script appearance. Nevertheless, more than one-thousand characters appearing in the oracle bone script can be identified, in modified form, in modern Chinese writing. What's more, speakers of other Asian languages adopted and modified Archaic Chinese, eventually leading to the development of writing systems for Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean, among other languages.

Chinese writing, basically logographic writing system, one of the world's great writing systems. Like Semitic writing in the West, Chinese script was fundamental to the writing systems in the East. Until relatively recently, Chinese writing was more widely in use than alphabetic writing systems, and until the 18th century more than half of the world's books were written in Chinese, including works of speculative thought, historical writings of a kind, and novels, along with writings on government and law. History It is not known when Chinese writing originated, but it apparently began to develop in the early 2nd millennium bc. The earliest known inscriptions, each of which contains between 10 and 60 characters incised on pieces of bone and tortoiseshell that were used for oracular divination, date from the Shang (or Yin) dynasty (18th-12th century bc), but, by then it was already a highly developed system, essentially similar to its present form. By 1400 bc the script included some 2,500 to 3,000 characters, most of which can be read to this day. Later stages in the development of Chinese writing include the guwen (""ancient figures"") found in inscriptions from the late Shang dynasty (c. 1123 bc) and the early years of the Zhou dynasty that followed. The major script of the Zhou dynasty, which ruled from 1046 to 256 bc, was the dazhuan (""great seal""), also called the Zhou wen (""Zhou script""). By the end of the Zhou dynasty the dazhuan had degenerated to some extent. The script was fixed in its present form during the Qin period (221-207 bc). The earliest graphs were schematic pictures of what they represented; the graph for man resembled a standing figure, that for woman depicted a kneeling figure. Because basic characters or graphs were ""motivated""--that is, the graph was made to resemble the object it represented--it was once thought that Chinese writing is ideographic, representing ideas rather than the structures of a language. It is now recognized that the system represents the Chinese language by means of a logographic script. Each graph or character corresponds to one meaningful unit of the language, not directly to a unit of thought. Although it was possible to make up simple signs to represent common objects, many words were not readily picturable. To represent such words the phonographic principle was adopted. A graph that pictured some object was borrowed to write a different word that happened to sound similar. With this invention the Chinese approached the form of writing invented by the Sumerians. However, because of the enormous number of Chinese words that sound the same, to have carried through the phonographic principle would have resulted in a writing system in which many of the words could be read in more than one way. That is, a written character would be extremely ambiguous. The solution to the problem of character ambiguity, adopted about 213 bc (during the reign of the first Qin emperor, Shihuangdi), was to distinguish two words having the same sound and represented by the same graph by adding another graph to give a clue to the meaning of the particular word intended. Such complex graphs or characters consist of two parts, one part suggesting the sound, the other part the meaning. The system was then standardized so as to approach the ideal of one distinctive graph representing each morpheme, or unit of meaning, in the language. The limitation is that a language that has thousands of morphemes would require thousands of characters, and, as the characters are formed from simple lines in various orientations and arrangements, they came to possess great complexity. Not only did the principle of the script change with time, so too did the form of the graphs. The earliest writing consisted of carved inscriptions. Before the beginning of the Christian Era the script came to be written with brush and ink on paper. The result was that the shapes of the graphs lost their pictorial, ""motivated"" quality. The brushwork allowed a great deal of scope for aesthetic considerations. The relation between the written Chinese language and its oral form is very different from the analogous relation between written and spoken English. In Chinese many different words are expressed by the identical sound pattern--188 different words are expressed by the syllable /yi/--while each of those words is expressed by a distinctive visual pattern. A piece of written text read orally is often quite incomprehensible to a listener because of the large number of homophones. In conversation, literate Chinese speakers frequently draw characters in the air to distinguish between homophones. Written text, on the other hand, is completely unambiguous. In English, by contrast, writing is often thought of as a reflection, albeit imperfect, of speech. To make the script easier to read, a system of transcribing Chinese into the Roman alphabet was adopted in 1958. The system was not intended to replace the logographic script but to indicate the sounds of graphs in dictionaries and to supplement graphs on such things as road signs and posters. A second reform simplified the characters by reducing the number of strokes used in writing them. Simplification, however, tends to make the characters more similar in appearance; thus they are more easily confused and the value of the reform is limited.",1,1,5,4
9,what did thomas hobbes do?,philosopher,Political philosophy,"Why is Thomas Hobbes important? Thomas Hobbes was an English philosopher, scientist, and historian best known for his political philosophy, especially as articulated in his masterpiece Leviathan (1651). His enduring contribution was as a political philosopher who justified wide-ranging government powers on the basis of the self-interested consent of citizens. In Hobbes's social contract, the many trade liberty for safety. What was Thomas Hobbes's childhood like? Hobbes's father was a quick-tempered vicar who, disgraced after engaging in a brawl at his own church door, disappeared, abandoning his three children to the care of his brother, a glover. When Hobbes was 4, he was sent to school at Westport, Wiltshire, then to a private school, and, at 15, to Magdalen Hall, Oxford. What did Thomas Hobbes do for a living? For nearly the whole of his adult life, Thomas Hobbes was employed by members of the wealthy and aristocratic Cavendish family and their associates as tutor, translator, traveling companion, keeper of accounts, business representative, political adviser, and scientific collaborator. How did Thomas Hobbes influence others? Thomas Hobbes's political philosophy influenced not only successors who adopted the social-contract framework--John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant, for example--but also less directly those theorists who connected moral and political decision making in rational human beings to considerations of self-interest broadly understood. Thomas Hobbes (born April 5, 1588, Westport, Wiltshire, England--died December 4, 1679, Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire) was an English philosopher, scientist, and historian, best known for his political philosophy, especially as articulated in his masterpiece Leviathan (1651). Hobbes viewed government primarily as a device for ensuring collective security. Political authority is justified by a hypotheticalsocial contract among the many that vests in a sovereign person or entity the responsibility for the safety and well-being of all. In metaphysics, Hobbes defended materialism, the view that only material things are real. His scientific writings present all observed phenomena as the effects of matter in motion. Hobbes was not only a scientist in his own right but a great systematizer of the scientific findings of his contemporaries, including Galileo and Johannes Kepler. His enduring contribution is as a political philosopher who justified wide-ranging government powers on the basis of the self-interested consent of citizens. Early life Who was philosopher Thomas Hobbes?Questions and answers about Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes's father was a quick-tempered vicar of a small Wiltshire parish church. Disgraced after engaging in a brawl at his own church door, he disappeared and abandoned his three children to the care of his brother, a well-to-do glover in Malmesbury. When he was four years old, Hobbes was sent to school at Westport, then to a private school, and finally, at 15, to Magdalen Hall in the University of Oxford, where he took a traditional arts degree and in his spare time developed an interest in maps. For nearly the whole of his adult life, Hobbes worked for different branches of the wealthy and aristocratic Cavendish family. Upon taking his degree at Oxford in 1608, he was employed as page and tutor to the young William Cavendish, afterward the second earl of Devonshire. Over the course of many decades Hobbes served the family and their associates as translator, traveling companion, keeper of accounts, business representative, political adviser, and scientific collaborator. Through his employment by William Cavendish, the first earl of Devonshire, and his heirs, Hobbes became connected with the royalist side in disputes between the king and Parliament that continued until the 1640s and that culminated in the English Civil Wars (1642-51). Hobbes also worked for the marquess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, a cousin of William Cavendish, and Newcastle's brother, Sir Charles Cavendish. The latter was the centre of the ""Wellbeck Academy,"" an informal network of scientists named for one of the family houses at Wellbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire.

Calvin and Hobbes is a daily American comic strip created by cartoonist Bill Watterson that was syndicated from November 18, 1985, to December 31, 1995. Commonly described as ""the last great newspaper comic"", Calvin and Hobbes has enjoyed enduring popularity, influence, and academic and even a philosophical interest. Calvin and Hobbes follows the humorous antics of the title characters: Calvin, a mischievous and adventurous six-year-old boy; and his friend Hobbes, a sardonic tiger. Set in the suburban United States of the 1980s and 1990s, the strip depicts Calvin's frequent flights of fancy and friendship with Hobbes. It also examines Calvin's relationships with his long-suffering parents and with his classmates, especially his neighbor Susie Derkins. Hobbes's dual nature is a defining motif for the strip: to Calvin, Hobbes is a living anthropomorphic tiger, while all the other characters seem to see Hobbes as an inanimate stuffed toy, though Watterson has not clarified exactly how Hobbes is perceived by others, or whether he is real or an imaginary friend. Though the series does not frequently mention specific political figures or ongoing events, it does explore broad issues like environmentalism, public education, and philosophical quandaries. At the height of its popularity, Calvin and Hobbes was featured in over 2,400 newspapers worldwide. In 2010, reruns of the strip appeared in more than 50 countries, and nearly 45 million copies of the Calvin and Hobbes books have been sold worldwide. == History == === Development === Calvin and Hobbes was conceived when Bill Watterson, while working in an advertising job he detested, began devoting his spare time to developing a newspaper comic for potential syndication. He explored various strip ideas but all were rejected by the syndicates. United Feature Syndicate finally responded positively to one strip called The Doghouse, which featured a side character (the main character's little brother) who had a stuffed tiger. United identified these characters as the strongest and encouraged Watterson to develop them as the center of their own strip. Though United Feature ultimately rejected the new strip as lacking in marketing potential, Universal Press Syndicate took it up. === Launch and early success (1985–1990) === The first Calvin and Hobbes strip was published on November 18, 1985 in 35 newspapers. The strip quickly became popular. Within a year of syndication, the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers and proved to have international appeal with translation and wide circulation outside the United States. Although Calvin and Hobbes underwent continual artistic development and creative innovation over the period of syndication, the earliest strips demonstrated a remarkable consistency with the latest. Watterson introduced all the major characters within the first three weeks and made no changes to the central cast over the strip's 10-year history. By April 5, 1987, Watterson was featured in an article in the Los Angeles Times. Calvin and Hobbes earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988. He was nominated another time in 1992. The Society awarded him the Humor Comic Strip Award for 1988. Calvin and Hobbes has also won several more awards. As his creation grew in popularity, there was strong interest from the syndicate to merchandise the characters and expand into other forms of media. Watterson's contract with the syndicate allowed the characters to be licensed without the creator's consent, as was standard at the time. Nevertheless, Watterson had leverage by threatening to simply walk away from the comic strip. This dynamic played out in a long and emotionally draining battle between Watterson and his syndicate editors. By 1991, Watterson had achieved his goal of securing a new contract that granted him legal control over his creation and all future licens",1,1,1,1
10,who is the state governor of florida?,Ron DeSantis,Rick Scott,"The governor of Florida is the head of government of the U.S. state of Florida. The governor is the head of the executive branch of the government of Florida and is the commander-in-chief of the Florida National Guard. The current officeholder is Ron DeSantis, a member of the Republican Party who took office on January 8, 2019. == List of governors == === Federal military commissioner === Spanish Florida was acquired from Spain in the Adams–Onís Treaty, which took effect July 10, 1821. Parts of West Florida had already been assigned to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi; the remainder and East Florida were governed by a military commissioner with the powers of governor until the territory was organized and incorporated. === Territory of Florida === Florida Territory was organized on March 30, 1822, combining East and West Florida. === State of Florida === The State of Florida was admitted to the Union on March 3, 1845. It seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America on February 8, 1861, as a founding member. Following the end of the American Civil War, it was part of the Third Military District. Florida was readmitted to the Union on June 25, 1868. The Florida Constitution of 1838 provided that a governor be elected every 4 years, who was not allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist constitution of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected constitution of 1865 and the ratified constitution of 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution. The current constitution of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term. The start of a term was set in 1885 at the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the January following the election, where it has remained. Originally, the president of the state senate acted as governor should that office be vacant. The 1865 and 1868 constitutions created the office of lieutenant governor, who would similarly act as governor. This office was abolished in 1885, with the president of the senate again taking on that duty. The 1968 constitution recreated the office of lieutenant governor, who now becomes governor in the absence of the governor. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket. Florida was a strongly Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only one candidate from the Whig Party (the Democrats' chief opposition at the time). It elected three Republican governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 90 years passed before voters chose another Republican. Since 1998, it has been a strongly Republican state. == Acting governor == Florida has had a number of people serve as acting governor. The state's first three constitutions provided that the succession in office became operative whenever the governor was out of the state. Thus, in 1853 when Governor Thomas Brown attended an event in Boston—the Senate president who would normally succeed the governor at the time was also out of state. Therefore, the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, A.K. Allison, became acting governor on September 16, 1853. He served for 17 days. Article IV Section 3 (b) of the Florida Constitution now calls for the lieutenant governor to ""act as Governor"" during the governor's physical or mental incapacity. This provision has been invoked one time. On June 18, 2008, Governor Charlie Crist filed a proclamation with the secretary of state transferring power of governor to Lt. Governor Jeff Kottkamp pursuant to the constitutional provision while he underwent knee surgery. == See also == Gubernatorial lines of succession in the United States#Flor

Florida Governors Beginning with Governor Francis Fleming in the 1890s, every chief executive of Florida has had an official portrait painted and hung in the state capitol building. Over the years, an interesting variety of artistic styles has accumulated. In the mid-1950s, the state legislature commissioned Tallahassee artist Clarabel Jett (1908-96) to create oil-enhanced photographs of all Florida governors whose portraits were not yet in the state collection. In 1986, the legislature transferred custody of the portrait collection to the Museum of Florida History. All of the Governors' portraits are represented at the Historic Capitol. The more recent governors' portraits appear in the first-floor hallway of the new Capitol, beginning with Claude Kirk (1967-1971). In keeping with the tradition of official governors' portraits, our current governor, Ron DeSantis, will not commission his portrait until the end of his term. These are colorful portraits of colorful people, all of whom have been Florida history makers. Under Florida law, e-mail addresses are public records. If you do not want your e-mail address released in response to a public records request, do not send electronic mail to this entity. Instead, contact this office by phone or in writing.

The lieutenant governor of Florida is a statewide constitutional office in the executive branch of the U.S. state of Florida. It is the second highest-ranking official in the state government. The lieutenant governor is elected on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Official duties dictated to the lieutenant governor under the present Florida Constitution are to serve as the acting governor in the absence of the governor from the state or the disability of the governor, or to become governor in the event of the governor's death, resignation or removal from office via impeachment. Jeanette Nuñez is the 20th and current lieutenant governor of Florida, in office since January 2019 under Ron DeSantis. == History == The position of lieutenant governor has been used in Florida's government twice in the state's history. The first period spanned from 1865, after the American Civil War, through 1889. During this time, the lieutenant governor was elected independently of the governor. In addition to being first in succession to the governor, the lieutenant governor was the ex officio president of the Florida Senate, and could cast a vote in the case of a tie. William W. J. Kelly was the first person elected lieutenant governor after the position was created by the 1865 Constitution of Florida. The position was officially abolished by the post-Reconstruction Constitution of 1885, with the last lieutenant governor, Milton H. Mabry, serving out his term until 1889. After this point the office of President of the Senate was given to an elected member of the Senate, who also served as first in line of succession to the governor. The current Florida Constitution of 1968 recreated the office of lieutenant governor who is now elected directly along with the governor as a running mate. The lieutenant governor serves as first in the line of succession, but the office of President of the Senate remains with an elected senator. The lieutenant governor has a few prescribed duties and otherwise assists the governor with the duties of the executive branch. The first lieutenant governor under the current Constitution was Ray C. Osborne, who took office in 1969. The state constitution also forbids anyone from being elected lieutenant governor more than twice. == List of lieutenant governors == Parties No party Democratic (7) Republican (13) == List of acting lieutenant governors == Parties No party Democratic (7) Republican (13) == See also == Florida Florida Constitution Florida Democratic Party Florida State Capitol List of governors of Florida List of current United States Lieutenant Governors Republican Party of Florida == References == == External links == Manuscript Collections of Florida Lieutenant Governors The Political Graveyard: Florida: Lieutenant Governors",1,1,5,5

ABSTRACT Bruce Lee brought attention to martial arts in the Western world and popularized the quote 'Be water, my friend'. Lee died at the age of 32 years in Hong Kong on 20 July 1973, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of death is unknown, although numerous hypotheses have been proposed, from assassination by gangsters to the more recent suggestion in 2018 that he died from heatstroke. The necropsy showed cerebral oedema. A prior episode was diagnosed as cerebral oedema 2 months earlier. We now propose, based on an analysis of publicly available information, that the cause of death was cerebral oedema due to hyponatraemia. In other words, we propose that the kidney's inability to excrete excess water killed Bruce Lee. In this regard, Lee had multiple risk factors for hyponatraemia that may have included high chronic fluid intake, factors that acutely increase thirst (marijuana) and factors that decrease the ability of the kidneys to excrete water by either promoting secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or interfering with water excretion mechanisms in kidney tubules: prescription drugs (diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, antiepileptic drugs), alcohol, chronic low solute intake, a past history of acute kidney injury and exercise. The death of Bruce Lee Bruce Lee was the most influential martial artist of all time. He inspired millions of people and brought attention to martial arts in the Western world. He was born Lee Jun-fan on 27 November 1940, in San Francisco, California, while his opera singer father was touring the United States. He returned with his parents to Hong Kong as an infant and worked as a child actor. At age 13, he began learning martial arts. At age 18, he returned to the United States where he studied drama and philosophy and opened a martial arts school. At age 26, he first appeared as a martial arts fighter on American television. Lee created his own combat method that he called Jeet Kune Do or the Way of the Intercepting Fist, which combined different training methods such as kung fu, fencing, boxing and philosophy. He popularized philosophical quotes, such as the one starting 'Be water, my friend...' [1]. He returned to Hong Kong at the age of 29, where he became a writer, director, lead actor and fight scene choreographer. Lee died at the age of 32 in Hong Kong on 20 July 1973, under mysterious circumstances. Up to now, the cause of Bruce Lee's death is unknown, although numerous hypotheses have been put forward, from assassination by triad gangsters to the more recent suggestion in 2018 that he died from heatstroke (Table 1) [2, 3]. Table 1. Theories about the cause of Bruce Lee's death. Theories For Against Hypersensitivity to Equagesic Official cause of death Not first time of consumption No typical salicylate overdose signs/symptoms Toxicology report (?) Assassinated by Mafia (Italian, Chinese, or American) 2 weeks before death, Lee threatened Lo Wei, who was reported to have mobster connections No evidence of physical injury or poison in autopsy Family curse Lee's son, Brandon Lee, died at the age of 28 years: he was shot in a film set when a prop gun fired a live bullet Bruce Lee's older brother died at the age of 3 months under mysterious circumstances Cannabis Necropsy found marijuana in stomach Oral ingestion is not likely to lead to acute intoxication Heatstroke 20 July 1973 was reported to be a very warm day 20 July 1973 not warmer than average for summer in Hong Kong Sudden death is unusual No evidence of multiorgan dysfunction in necropsy The facts Some facts about Bruce Lee's death are public [3]. On the day of his death, he and the producer of his films, Raymond Chow, drove to the house of Betty Ting Pei, who was thought to be the mistress of Lee. Lee spent some hours alone with Ting Pei and used marijuana before driving to the house, and while there Lee actively acted out some scenes of an upcoming movie. He experienced headache and dizziness around 7:30 pm, after drinking water. Ting Pei gave him an 'Equagesic' pill (a combination of meprobamate and aspirin which he had taken before) and Lee went to the bedroom to rest. Raymond Chow left at that time. At 9:30 pm, Ting Pei found Lee unconscious. She called Chow who went to the house and tried to wake Lee up without success. They called a doctor, who spent another 10 min unsuccessfully doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Lee was sent to the nearest hospital, where he was pronounced dead. At autopsy, there were no signs of external injuries and no tongue bite. Severe cerebral oedema had resulted in brain weight of 1575 g compared with the normal 1400 g [4]. Traces of marijuana were found in the stomach. Bruce Lee's death was officially ruled to be the result of cerebral oedema caused by hypersensitivity to Equagesic. Theories about the cause of death Among the multiple plausible and implausible causes of death, three merit discussion. Cerebral oedema caused by hypersensitivity to Equagesic [5]. Hypersensitivity to the components of Equagesic (aspirin and meprobamate) was identified as the official cause of death [4]. However, Lee had taken this drug before [3] and on the day of his death, he took it AFTER he felt unwell, already having symptoms that may be explained by cerebral oedema (i.e. headache) and cerebral oedema would not be expected to be the only necropsy finding if indeed hypersensitivity to Equagesic was the cause of death. Epilepsy. A seizure was considered a potential cause of the 10 May 1973 episode described below, although as it was a sole episode, a diagnosis of epilepsy was not made. On 29 and 30 May 1973, Lee underwent a full neurologic evaluation: 'a complete physical, a brain flow study, and an electroencephalogram', reviewed by neurologist David Reisbord, who did not find abnormalities in his brain functions [3]. Nevertheless, phenytoin was prescribed and Lee was on phenytoin up to the day of his death. Martial artists are at high risk of head trauma or even microtrauma [6]. The most important direct epilepsy-related cause of death is a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is more common in patients with chronic epilepsy [7]. Forensic reports can include tongue bites (20-40%), cerebral oedema and pulmonary oedema [7, 8]. The fact that he had no chronic epilepsy, was on antiepileptic drug therapy and had no tongue bite in necropsy argue against this diagnosis. Heatstroke. This latest hypothesis about the cause of death was proposed by Matthew Polly in his 2018 book Bruce Lee, A Life [3]. Heatstroke refers to when body core temperature increases above 40degC, associated with hot dry skin and central nervous system abnormalities [9]. In 2014, the Japanese Association of Acute Medicine (JAAM), published criteria for heat-related illnesses, including heatstroke. A 2016 JAAM Heat Stroke Working Group simplified heatstroke definition to consider patients exposed to high environmental temperature and at least one of the following criteria: (i) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of <=14; (ii) creatinine or total bilirubin levels of >=1.2 mg/dL; (iii) JAAM Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) score of >=4 [10]. Typically, heatstroke results from strenuous exercise (exertional) or from an inability to regulate body temperature (non-exertional), in patients with risk factors such as older age, obesity, heart disease, dementia and others [9]. Initially, heat exposure leading to hyperthermia facilitates the leakage of endotoxin from intestinal mucosa and interleukins from muscles to the systemic circulation, thereby causing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome [10], disruption of the blood-brain barrier and cerebral oedema [11]. Typically, the disorder has three phases resulting in death after 24-96 h, hence sudden death is unusual [12]. Matthew Polly [13] hypothesized that Lee's removal of axillary sweat glands a month prior to 10 May 1973 could increase the risk of heatstroke. However, sweat is produced through most of the skin surface and sweat output may vary from 0.002 mg/min/gland in the foot's dorsum to 0.016 mg/min/gland in the chest [14]. Thus, it is unlikely that axillary sweat gland removal alone could facilitate heatstroke. Polly further suggested that the 10 May 1973 episode was probably also due to heatstroke [13] and that both days had been uncharacteristically warm for Hong Kong. However, profuse sweating was described during the 10 May episode, despite axillary sweat gland removal [4], the 25degC and 32degC temperatures in both days are common in Hong Kong and there is no evidence that a previous heatstroke episode is a risk factor for a recurrent episode [12]. Overall, the time-course, ability to sweat and lack of extreme weather and of reports by witnesses of excessive heat or skin temperature or dry skin despite a warm environment argue against heatstroke. Causes of cerebral oedema Any hypothesis about the cause of death should account for the necropsy finding of cerebral oedema without further evidence of central nervous system injury and for the acute time-course of the final illness. The four main pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebral oedema are as follows. (i) Vasogenic; commonly seen in conditions with disruption of the blood-brain barrier, e.g. peritumor oedema. (ii) Cellular or cytotoxic; the consequence of brain injury, such as trauma or stroke. (iii) Interstitial oedema resulting from the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid from the intraventricular space to interstitial areas, e.g. hydrocephalus or meningitis. (iv) Osmotic oedema; in which the cells of the brain pull water from the plasma, due to a disequilibrium in osmolarity, e.g. during hyponatraemia [15]. Thus, hyponatraemia stands out as a serious possibility that may account for cerebral oedema and the time-course of the illness, as it is well accepted that acute hyponatraemia itself can be lethal if not treated promptly [16]. Could hyponatraemia-induced cerebral oedema have killed Bruce Lee? Water homeostasis The balance of water in the body is regulated by plasma osmolarity: increased plasma osmolarity (hypertonicity) is sensed by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus that regulate both antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release and thirst (Figure 1). Serum sodium concentration (natraemia) reflects water balance. Natraemia is the main contributor to serum osmolarity and an increase in natraemia (and the associated increase in serum osmolarity) will trigger compensatory mechanisms, i.e. thirst, leading to water ingestion and increased secretion of ADH (vasopressin), leading to decreased kidney excretion of water, i.e. a lower volume of more concentrated urine. Conversely, excess body water will decrease natraemia and serum osmolality, leading to the disappearance of thirst and ADH (which has an extremely short half-life) and thus, increased kidney excretion of water in more dilute urine, leading to polyuria and restoring homeostasis. Other forms of water elimination, such as breathing, faeces and sweat, are not regulated. The adaptive capacity of the kidneys is large and in patients with defects in urine concentration (e.g. genetic defects in ADH receptors or aquaporin 2) urine volumes may reach 18-20 L/day. Therefore, it is unusual to develop hyponatraemia (i.e. water intoxication) unless the rate of water intake is clearly superior to this rate of water excretion or there are predisposing factors that limit the kidney's ability to excrete water. However, this high volume may be surpassed by excessive free water drinking over short periods of time: urinating 20 L/day would translate into being able to handle an excess free water intake of around 0.8 L/h. Acute or hyperacute water loading during 'dare' activities involving ingestion of large amounts of water over a short period of time is a cause of cerebral oedema and death within a few hours, even for individuals without risk factors for hyponatraemia. Death due to hyponatraemia leading to cerebral oedema can occur within a few hours of greatly exceeding this rate of water intake, as in recent cases in which 7-8 L of water were ingested within a few hours during 'dare activities' [17, 18]. These persons are usually young and healthy. However, even if a reasonable water intake limit is not exceeded, there are factors that limit the kidneys' ability to excrete a water load, further decreasing the safe amounts of water intake when water intake is not needed. These factors may result in severe hyponatraemia from drinking a much lower water load. Could hyponatraemia have occurred in an apparently healthy young sportsman like Lee? FIGURE 1: Water balance homeostasis and Bruce Lee's risk factors for hyponatraemia. Hypernatraemia means that there is a deficiency in extracellular water and the body adapts by increasing water intake through thirst and decreasing water loss in urine by secreting antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which results in more a concentrated, lower amount of urine (A). If hyponatraemia develops, these mechanisms will be shut down, resulting in an increased volume of more dilute urine (B). Severe hyponatraemia may result from failure to timely shut down mechanisms that increase water intake and decrease water excretion once hyponatraemia has developed (C). Severe hyponatraemia may trigger cerebral oedema and herniation through the foramen magnum in the occipital bone of the skull, resulting in death within hours. Green arrows indicate adaptive mechanisms. Red arrows indicate mechanisms that are inappropriately activated and not in line with physiological needs to maintain water homeostasis. Lee had several risk factors for severe hyponatraemia that interfered with all levels of control of water balance, from thirst to ADH secretion to ADH action in the kidneys to decrease water excretion in urine. Past personal history potentially relevant to the cause of death The existence of predisposing factors that interfere with water excretion by the kidneys is the most common cause of hyponatraemia and Lee did not appear to have drunk 6-8 L of free water as in some case reports of excessive water ingestion by healthy people. So, did Lee have factors predisposing to hyponatraemia? A brief overview of publicly available information suggests that this is the case. Prior cerebral oedema episode. Lee had suffered a first episode of cerebral oedema 2 months earlier. On 10 May 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong doing a dubbing session. Polly refers to a visit to the bathroom, hash use, headache ('He felt faint and his head hurt'), disorientation and inability to walk ('While in the bathroom, Bruce became disoriented and collapsed facedown on the floor', 'Sweating star wobbled back to the dubbing room on rubbery legs. The moment he stepped inside the scorching room he fainted again, losing consciousness. Then he vomited his lunch of spaghetti and his body began convulsing' [3] (Table 2). They took him to Baptist Hospital where cerebral oedema was diagnosed and treated with mannitol. Lee recovered, and on 25 May 1973, he was examined in the United States by Dr. Harold L. Karpman. In his book Unsettled Matters, Tom Bleecker states that during the inquest on Lee's death, 'Dr Karpman said that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at Baptist Hospital had been 92 mg/dL, but was normal on May 25 when Karpman examined Lee' [4]. Thus, Lee appeared to have had acute kidney injury (AKI) and kidney dysfunction is a risk factor for hyponatraemia. A neurologist mentioned that Lee might have an idiopathic seizure disorder and prescribed phenytoin, but epilepsy was not diagnosed as this was an isolated episode. Lee's wife, Linda, stated: 'Dr Reisbord told me that at no time had Bruce suffered from epilepsy' [13]. Table 2. Lee's symptoms as compared with a prior report of a patient dying from hyperacute hyponatraemia-induced cerebral oedema. Jennifer Strange participated in a radio show contest called 'Hold your wee for a wii' and drank 6-7 L of water in under 3 h before dying from severe hyponatraemia [19]. Other examples can be found in a recent review [20]. Lee Jennifer Strange Headache Headache 'Feel faint' 'Feel lightheaded' Difficulty standing/walking. 'wobbled back to the dubbing room on rubbery legs' Excess water intake. Lee's wife Linda referred to a fluid-based diet ('carrot and apple juice'). On the evening that Lee died, Polly repeatedly refers to water intake during the day, including just before Lee became noticeably ill. 'I think we had some water... that probably made him a little tired and thirsty. After a few sips he seemed to be a little dizzy... Immediately after feeling faint, Bruce complained of a headache' [3]. The excess fluid intake appears to have become a habit for Lee. We suggest that the fact that water intake was repeatedly noticed when it is such a commonplace activity that might have been forgotten given the exceptional circumstances means that it was indeed noticeably higher than the intake of other persons present on the day that Lee died. Cannabis. The use of multiple drugs use by Lee has been reported by Bleecker and multiple sources comment on his frequent uses of hash or marijuana, including on his final day. In July 2021, the English newspaper The Times, published a piece of a newly found letter collection written by Bruce Lee: 'Stoned as hell, but am working on the up-coming character, some coke would help in the formation of what I want to create' [22]. On the evening that Lee died, Polly repeatedly refers to cannabis use throughout the day. Cannabis causes thirst [23] and may have been driving water intake despite the putative presence of hyponatraemia that we hypothesize. Hyponatraemia has also been linked to cocaine, although reports are uncommon [24]. However, there is no publicly available evidence of cocaine use on the day of his death. Alcohol. Alcohol use has been linked to an increased risk of hyponatraemia. There are reports of increased alcohol intake in the last months of Lee's life: 'would drink ten to twenty ceramic bottles of sake in an evening.' 'Near the end,' Lowe added, 'Bruce was often very tired and dizzy' [4]; his friends say he was drinking alcohol more frequently [3]. Low dietary solute intake. The association of excess alcohol intake with hyponatraemia is in part related to a low dietary solute intake. There is evidence that indeed in his last months, Lee's solute intake was low while water intake was high. An abnormal dietary pattern had been observed by physicians. Bleecker states that 'Dr Au's advised Bruce to begin eating a balanced and proper diet' and 'According to Linda, during her husband's final months, he had stopped eating solid food and was existing miserably on carrot and apple juice' [4]. This dietary pattern of mostly fluid may have explained the weight loss that appears to have accelerated between May and July 1973. In textbooks, this low solute diet has been labelled as a 'tea and toast diet' (Table 3). Table 3. Major causes of hypotonic hyponatraemia [21]. Those that may have applied to Lee, according to publicly available information, are underlined. Bleecker states that Lee complained to Dr. Harold L. Karpman in May 1973 of a poor appetite and that he had lost 20 pounds over a 2-year period. He further adds: 'In Bruce's particular case, it is important to realize that a loss of twenty pounds of body weight over a two-year period is highly significant. Besides his overuse of diuretics, which significantly reduced his body's percentage of water, Bruce had an extremely low percentage of body fat. The result was that under these conditions a loss of over 14% of his body's muscular mass was noticeable in Bruce and made him appear emaciated...' And 'From the day of his near-fatal collapse on May 10 to the day he died nearly ten weeks later, Bruce underwent an inexplicable and startling weight loss' [4]. Polly indicates, referring to the May event: 'He had lost 15% of his total body weight in the previous two months, and he had minimal body fat to start'; 'But to me, he seemed awfully run down. In all the years I knew him, I never saw him in such an emaciated condition before.' 'Yeah, I've lost a lot of weight from working day and night,' Bruce explained... 'I even forget to eat' [3]. Prescription drugs. Prescription drugs may be the primary cause of severe hyponatraemia [25]. However, the molecular mechanisms of the contribution of some drugs to hyponatraemia have not been completely clarified or may involve several mechanisms. Bleecker writes that during the inquest, 'he quickly became bored with the complex scientific analysis of the wide assortment of prescription drugs Bruce had been taking' [4]. This points to the use of other prescription drugs that may have had an impact over predisposition to hyponatraemia. These included diuretics, phenytoin and painkillers (e.g. opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs). Lee was taking phenytoin and Doloxene (dextropropoxyphene, an analgesic in the opioid category, apparently in combination with aspirin) [3]. Diuretics. Diuretic use may have contributed to both AKI and hyponatraemia. Bleecker [4] states that 'Bruce was a frequent user of diuretics. Although this greatly reduced the excessive water content in his muscles, and thus gave him the desired 'ripped' appearance, it was a dangerous practice that frequently placed him in a life-threatening state of dehydration' [4]. While we have no clear idea of what diuretics were involved, thiazides are known to cause hyponatraemia, while loop diuretics increase free water clearance in persons with normal kidney function. However, even loop diuretics favour hyponatraemia primarily due to hypovolaemia-induced release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), especially if water intake is high and distal delivery is very low, as may occur during diuretic-induced kidney dysfunction [26]. Opioids. We found no report on dextropropoxyphene and hyponatraemia, but other opioids, such as tramadol may cause hyponatraemia [27]. Opioids may promote ADH secretion but may also favour hyponatraemia when ADH is absent [28]. Additionally, they may suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone, favouring secondary adrenal insufficiency, another cause of hyponatraemia [29]. Opioids are mostly associated with hyponatraemia in combination with other drugs predisposing to hyponatraemia [30, 31]. NSAIDs. NSAIDs decrease the inhibitory effect of prostaglandins on the activity of ADH, favouring hyponatraemia under conditions of non-suppressible ADH such as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or in the presence of volume depletion (as may be expected in diuretic users), and increase the risk of hyponatraemia in patients on diuretics [18]. However, aspirin is among the NSAIDs with a lower impact on natraemia. Antiepileptic drugs. Diverse antiepileptic drugs can predispose to hyponatraemia. For newly initiated antiepileptic drugs, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for hospitalization due to hyponatraemia, compared with controls, have been reported to be 9.63 (6.18-15.33) for carbamazepine and 4.83 (1.14-25.76) for phenytoin [32]. The risk is lower for chronic users. Anabolic steroids and adrenal insufficiency. According to Bleecker, Lee had been on and off anabolic steroids that he combined with diuretics to prevent steroid-induced fluid retention [4]. While off steroids, Bleecker suggested that he may have developed adrenal insufficiency. It is unclear what steroids he might have used and whether they may have suppressed adrenal function leading to adrenal insufficiency while off them, as performance-enhancing steroids usually have androgenic properties. However, chronic administration of opiates has the potential to cause secondary adrenal insufficiency [33] while phenytoin accelerates the metabolism of cortisol [34] and the combination of both may exacerbate any underlying predisposition to adrenal insufficiency. As indicated above, adrenal insufficiency is a further cause of hyponatraemia. Kidney dysfunction. Lee appeared to have had an episode of AKI (i.e. an acute decrease in the kidney function of glomerular filtration) at the time of the first cerebral oedema episode that later recovered. This is unusual for an apparently healthy person, but diuretics may decrease kidney function through hypovolemia (i.e. loss of sodium in the urine). AKI may interfere with several kidney functions, including water excretion. Exercise. Exercise-associated hyponatraemia is defined as hyponatraemia occurring during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity [35]. It has been mainly observed in endurance athletes in long events such as marathons. It is thought to depend on excess water intake when ADH is suboptimally suppressed because of intense exercise itself, nausea and/or vomiting, hypoglycaemia, pain, or release of muscle-derived interleukin-6 and may be exacerbated by NSAIDs [31]. Lee's exercise while actively acting out some scenes in his last day of life does not appear to qualify as a single trigger for exercise-associated hyponatraemia, it could have been a further contributing factor on top of those already discussed. Summary of the evidence The answer to the question of whether Lee had factors predisposing to hyponatraemia is yes, not only one, but multiple factors that predispose to hyponatraemia: High chronic fluid intake. Factors that acutely increase thirst and water intake: marijuana, plus evidence that he was repeatedly drinking water on the day of his death. Factors that decrease the ability of the kidney to excrete a water load because they either increase ADH secretion or impair the collecting tubular response to ADH: prescription drugs (diuretics, NSAIDs, opioids, antiepileptic drugs), alcohol, chronic low solute intake, potentially an acute decrease in glomerular filtration rate such as that observed in May 1973, and exercise. In summary, Lee had multiple risk factors predisposing to hyponatraemia resulting from interference with water homeostasis mechanisms that regulate both water intake and water excretion (Table 3, Figure 1), a clinical presentation consistent with hyponatraemia and a necropsy finding of cerebral oedema which is the cause of death in severe hyponatraemia. This predisposition may have caused pre-existing asymptomatic hyponatraemia, which is associated with a high risk for the development of worsening hyponatraemia with altered mental status [36]. Pre-existing hyponatraemia was found in over 70% of all patients admitted with symptomatic hyponatraemia and represented the most common risk factor identified. Additionally, in patients with a baseline risk of hyponatraemia due to other factors, an increase in the number of prescription drugs that predispose to hyponatraemia synergistically increases the risk of hyponatraemia (Figure 2) [31]. Thus, even if some of the risk factors identified in the present report were not actually present or had a mild influence by themselves, the presence of multiple risk factors may explain the sequence of events that led to Lee's demise. FIGURE 2: Prescription drugs and risk for hyponatraemia. A higher number of prescription drugs associated with hyponatraemia further increases the risk of hyponatraemia in patients with other predisposing factors. Bar graph built using data from reference [31]. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we hypothesize that Bruce Lee died from a specific form of kidney dysfunction: the inability to excrete enough water to maintain water homeostasis, which is mainly a tubular function. This may lead to hyponatraemia, cerebral oedema and death within hours if excess water intake is not matched by water excretion in urine, which is in line with the timeline of Lee's demise. Given that hyponatraemia is frequent, as is found in up to 40% of hospitalized persons [37] and may cause death due to excessive water ingestion even in young healthy persons, there is a need for a wider dissemination of the concept that excessive water intake can kill. The fact that we are 60% [38] water does not protect us from the potentially lethal consequences of drinking water at a faster rate than our kidneys can excrete excess water. Ironically, Lee made famous the quote 'Be water my friend', but excess water appears to have ultimately killed him.

Type: Federal republic. Independence: First proclaimed September 16, 1810; republic established 1824. Constitution: February 5, 1917. Branches: Executive--president (chief of state and head of government). Legislative--bicameral. Judicial--Supreme Court, local and federal systems. Political parties: Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), National Action Party (PAN), Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), Labor Party (PT), and several small parties. Suffrage: Universal at 18. Administrative subdivisions: 31 states and a federal district. Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world and the second-most populous country in Latin America after Portuguese-speaking Brazil. About 70% of the people live in urban areas. Many Mexicans emigrate from rural areas that lack job opportunities--such as the underdeveloped southern states and the crowded central plateau--to the industrialized urban centers and the developing areas along the U.S.-Mexico border. According to some estimates, the population of the area around Mexico City is about 20 million, which would make it the largest concentration of population in the world. Cities bordering on the United States, such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, and cities in the interior, such as Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Puebla, have undergone sharp rises in population. GOVERNMENT The 1917 constitution provides for a federal republic with powers separated into independent executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In practice, the executive is the dominant branch, with power vested in the president, who promulgates and executes the laws of the Congress. The president also legislates by executive decree in certain economic and financial fields, using powers delegated from the Congress. The president is elected by universal adult suffrage for a six-year term and may not hold office a second time. There is no vice president; in the event of the removal or death of the president, a provisional president is elected by the Congress. The Congress is composed of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. Consecutive re-election is prohibited. Senators are elected to six-year terms. Implementing constitutional changes made in 1996, for the first time on July 6, 1997, 32 of the 128 seats in the Senate will be elected by proportional representation from party lists on a national basis. With this change, some states may have more Senators than others. The 32 Senators elected in 1997 will only serve three-year terms, in order to bring the entire Senate back into the same cycle in the year 2000. Deputies serve three-year terms. In the lower chamber, 300 Deputies are directly elected to represent single-member districts, and 200 are selected by a modified form of proportional representation from five electoral regions created for this purpose across the country. The 200 proportional representation seats were created to help smaller parties gain access to the Chamber. The judiciary is divided into federal and state court systems, with federal courts having jurisdiction over most civil cases and those involving major felonies. Under the constitution, trial and sentencing must be completed within 12 months of arrest for crimes that would carry at least a two-year sentence. Practice often does not meet this requirement. Trial is by judge, not jury, in most criminal cases. Defendants have a right to counsel, and public defenders are available. Other rights include defense against self-incrimination, the right to confront one's accusers, and the right to a public trial. Supreme Court Justices are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. National Security Mexico's armed forces in 1995 numbered about 175,000. The army makes up about three-fourths of the total. One year of limited training is required of all males at age 18. Principal military roles include national defense, narcotics control, and civic action assignments such as road-building, search and rescue, and disaster relief. Mexico maintains an embassy in the United States at 1911 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20006 (tel. 202-728-1600). Consular offices are located at 2827 16th St. NW, 20009 (tel. 202-736-1012), and the trade office is co-located at the embassy (tel. 202-728-1686). Consulates general are located in Chicago, Dallas, Denver, El Paso, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, San Antonio, San Diego, and San Francisco; consulates are (partial listing) in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Philadelphia, Seattle, St. Louis, and Tucson. EDUCATION Although educational levels in Mexico have improved substantially in recent decades, the country still faces daunting problems. Education is one of the Government of Mexico's highest priorities and it has increased the education budget 7.2% over 1996 to $15 billion for 1997 -- one-fourth of the total budget. Education in Mexico is also being decentralized from federal to state authority in order to improve accountability. Education is mandatory from ages six through 18. The increase in school enrollments during the past two decades has been dramatic. By 1994, an estimated 59% of the population between the ages of six and 18 were enrolled in school. Primary (including preschool) enrollment in public schools from 1970 through 1994 increased from less than 10 million to 17.5 million. Enrollment at the secondary public school level rose from 1.4 million in 1972 to as many as 4.5 million in 1994. A rapid rise also occurred in higher education. Between 1959 and 1994, college enrollments rose from 62,000 to more than 1.2 million. Although education spending has risen dramatically, given increased enrollment, a net decline occurred in per student expenditures. The Mexican Government concedes that despite this progress, 2 million children still do not have access to basic education, and hopes to provide access to half of those children by the year 2000. ECONOMY Sustained economic growth is vital to Mexico's prospects for a successful evolution to a more competitive democracy. Mexico's level of economic prosperity has a direct, though proportionally smaller impact on the U.S. as it affects trade and migration. In recent years Mexico has sought economic prosperity through liberalization of its trade regime. In January 1994, Mexico joined Canada and the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which will phase out all tariffs over a 15-year period. Four months later, in April 1994, Mexico joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Mexico was the first Latin American member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), joining in 1993, and in January 1996, became a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Mexico's NAFTA membership helped the Mexican economy grow by 3.5% in 1994. Following the December 1994 devaluation of the peso, however, Mexico experienced a severe financial crisis that also threatened the stability of other emerging market economies, especially in Latin America. The United States responded by leading a group of international lenders in making available to Mexico over $40 billion in international financial assistance, including $20 billion from the United States. This action helped stabilize the Mexican economy, allowing Mexico to repay the loans to the United States more than three years ahead of schedule and with $580 million in interest. In 1996, Mexico's economy grew over 5%, recovering from the recession more briskly than anticipated. Inflation fell, unemployment fell and the peso stabilized. Mexican real GDP is expected to grow about 4% in 1997. Although the 1995 recession was severe, with real GDP falling 6.2%, tough stabilization measures averted an even more serious collapse and brought about a rapid recovery. NAFTA contributed to the process of adjustment by enabling Mexico to reduce its current account deficit through increased exports rather than through slashing imports from the United States, as it had following the 1982 debt crisis. U.S.-MEXICAN RELATIONS U.S. relations with Mexico are as important and complex as with any country in the world. A stable, democratic and economically prosperous Mexico is fundamental to U.S. interests. Our relations with Mexico have a direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans -- whether the issue is trade and economic reform, drug control, migration, or the promotion of democracy. The U.S. and Mexico are partners in NAFTA, and enjoy a rapidly developing trade relationship. The scope of U.S.-Mexican relations goes far beyond diplomatic and official contacts; it entails extensive commercial, cultural, and educational ties, as demonstrated by the nearly 290 million legal crossings from Mexico to the United States in fiscal year 1995. In addition, more than half a million American citizens live in Mexico. More than 2,600 U.S. companies have operations there, and the U.S. accounts for 60% of all foreign direct investment in Mexico. Along the 2,000-mile shared border, state and local governments interact closely. Since 1981, the management of the broad array of U.S.-Mexico issues has been formalized in the U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission, composed of numerous U.S. cabinet members and their Mexican counterparts. The Commission holds annual plenary meetings, and many sub-groups meet during the course of the year to discuss trade and investment opportunities, financial cooperation, consular issues and migration, legal affairs and anti-narcotics cooperation, cultural relations, education, energy, border cooperation, environment, labor, agriculture, health, housing and urban development, transportation, fisheries, tourism, and science and technology. A strong partnership with Mexico is critical to controlling the flow of illicit drugs into the United States. The U.S. has certified Mexico as fully cooperating in this effort based on an unprecedented level of cooperation on counternarcotics and Mexico's own initiatives in fighting drug trafficking. This is the best way to ensure that Mexico's cooperation and anti-drug efforts grow even stronger. During 1996, the U.S. and Mexico established a High-Level Contact Group (HLCG) on narcotics control to explore joint solutions to the shared drug threat, to coordinate the full range of narcotics issues and to promote closer law enforcement coordination. The United States and Mexico have a long history of cooperation on environmental and natural resources issues, particularly in the border area, where there are serious environmental problems caused by rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrialization. Cooperative activities between the U.S. and Mexico take place under a number of agreements such as: A 1944 treaty creating the International Boundary and Water Commission, which has a wide range of responsibilities for solving U.S.-Mexico water and boundary problems such as distributing the waters of the Colorado River and the Rio Grande between the two countries; jointly operating international dams and other joint flood control works along boundary rivers; and solving border water quality control problems. Since the early 1980's the IBWC has focused on border sanitation and groundwater resources. The 1983 La Paz Agreement to Protect and Improve the Border Environment. The 1993 North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation, created under NAFTA by the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, to strengthen environmental laws and address common environmental concerns; and A November 1993 agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, also under NAFTA, establishing the Border Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC) which works with local communities to build or upgrade environmental infrastructure such as wastewater treatment plants, drinking water systems, and solid waste disposal facilities; and the North American Development Bank (NADBANK), which leverages private sector capital to finance border environmental infrastructure projects certified by the BECC.",4,1,5,4
13,what kind of hispanic is selena gomez?,Latinx,Mexicans,"Guadalupe Ontiveros (née Moreno; September 17, 1942 – July 26, 2012) was an American actress best known for portraying Rosalita in The Goonies, and Yolanda Saldívar in the film Selena. She acted in numerous films and television shows. Ontiveros was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on Desperate Housewives and received critical acclaim for her role in Chuck & Buck, for which Ontiveros won the National Board of Review award for Best Supporting Actress, and was also nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. == Early life == Guadalupe Moreno was born on September 17, 1942, in El Paso, Texas, the daughter of Luz ""Lucita"" Castañón and Juan Moreno, middle-class Mexican immigrants who overcame a lack of formal education to become owners of a tortilla factory and two restaurants in El Paso. Lupe was raised Roman Catholic and graduated from El Paso High School and went on to study at Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas, where she received a bachelor's degree in social work in 1964. After marrying Elías Ontiveros in 1966, the couple moved to California to realize his dream of starting an automotive business. During a period of dissatisfaction with her career as a social worker, Ontiveros was trying to decide whether to go back to school for a nursing degree when she saw an article about a need for local film extras. With her husband's encouragement, Ontiveros took the job and parlayed it into a long stage and screen career. Prior to acting, she had worked for 18 years as a social worker, and Ontiveros continued as an activist with many of the same causes with which she worked in that profession, such as domestic violence prevention and AIDS awareness and prevention. == Career == === Film === Ontiveros once estimated that she had played a maid at least 150 times on stage and screen; Ontiveros wanted to see more diverse roles available to Latina actors, noting: ""I'm proud to represent those hands that labor in this country. I've given every maid I've ever portrayed soul and heart."" In part because of her history in this role, Ontiveros was chosen as the narrator for the documentary Maid in America. One of her most prominent early film roles was in the 1983 Gregory Nava film El Norte, in which Ontiveros played a seamstress and maid who acts as mentor to a newly arrived immigrant girl from Guatemala. In a 2004 interview with the Dominican newspaper Listin Diario, Ontiveros called El Norte ""the film that always will remain in me... [it] tells the immigrants' story"" when asked to name her favorite film from her long career. Ontiveros played the housekeeper, Rosalita, a Spanish-speaking maid hired to assist in the packing and moving of the Walsh family in the hit adventure film The Goonies (1985) and a housekeeper in Dolly Dearest (1992). Ontiveros also had a notable cameo appearance in Blood In Blood Out (1993) as Carmen, a drug dealer who Paco (Benjamin Bratt) busts in a sting operation as an undercover cop pretending to be a drug dealer. Ontiveros worked with Nava in subsequent films, including My Family/Mi Familia (1995) and Selena (1997). In the latter film, she portrayed Yolanda Saldívar, the murderer of Tejano superstar Selena. Long after the film was released, Ontiveros would still reportedly be ""hissed"" at by Selena fans while in public. Ontiveros also appeared in the Academy Award-winning film As Good as It Gets. In 2000, Ontiveros was featured in the film Chuck & Buck, in which she played Beverly, a tough theater director who puts on a play written by one of the film's main characters. Ontiveros said in multiple interviews that she accepted the role even before seeing the script, solely on the basis of being asked to play a character who was not defined by Hispanic ethnicity. For that role, Ontiveros was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture at the 2000 Independent Spirit Awards. During her acting career, Ontiveros participated in the web series Los Americans (2011), which is characterized by h

Mexico, officially the United Mexican States, is a country in the southern portion of North America. Covering 1,972,550 km2 (761,610 sq mi), it is the world's 13th largest country by area; with a population of over 130 million, it is the 10th most populous country and has the most Spanish speakers in the world. Mexico is a constitutional republic comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital and largest city, which is among the world's most populous metropolitan areas. The country borders the United States to the north; as well as Guatemala and Belize to the southeast. It has maritime borders with the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the southeast, and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. Human presence in Pre-Columbian Mexico dates back to 8,000 BC as one of six cradles of civilization. Mesoamerica hosted civilizations including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Purepecha. Aztec domination of the area preceded Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which established the colony of New Spain centered in the former capital, Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City). The Mexican War of Independence in the early 19th century was followed by political and socioeconomic upheaval. The Mexican–American War resulted in significant territorial losses in 1848. Liberal reforms introduced in the Constitution of 1857 prompted domestic conflict, French intervention, and the establishment of an Empire, countered by the Republican resistance led by Benito Juárez. The rise of Porfirio Díaz's dictatorship in the 19th century sparked the Mexican Revolution in 1910, which led to profound changes, such as the 1917 Constitution. Over the 20th century, Mexico experienced significant economic growth; as well as issues of repression and electoral fraud. The late 20th century saw a shift towards neoliberal policies, exemplified by the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, amidst unrest in Chiapas. Mexico is a federal republic with a presidential system of government, characterized by a democratic framework and the separation of powers into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The federal legislature consists of the bicameral Congress of the Union, comprising the Chamber of Deputies, which represents the population, and the Senate, which provides equal representation for each state. The Constitution establishes three levels of government: the federal Union, the state governments, and the municipal governments. Mexico's federal structure grants autonomy to its 32 states, and its political system is deeply influenced by indigenous traditions and European Enlightenment ideals. Mexico is a newly industrialized and developing country, with the world's 12th-largest economy by both nominal GDP and PPP. Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the world by the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is also one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, ranking fifth in natural biodiversity. It is a major tourist destination: as of 2022, it is the sixth most-visited country in the world, with 42.2 million international arrivals. Mexico's large economy and population, global cultural influence, and steady democratization make it a regional and middle power, increasingly identifying as an emerging power. However, as with much of Latin America, poverty, systemic corruption, and crime remain widespread. Since 2006, an ongoing conflict between drug trafficking syndicates has led to over 127,000 deaths. Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Organization of American States, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and the Organization of Ibero-American States. == Etymology == Mēxihco is the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the Aztec Empire, namely the Valley of Mexico and surrounding territories, with its people being known as the M

Francisco Vázquez de Coronado (Spanish pronunciation: [fɾanˈθisko ˈβaθkeθ ðe koɾoˈnaðo]; 1510 – 22 September 1554) was a Spanish conquistador and explorer who led a large expedition from what is now Mexico to present-day Kansas through parts of the southwestern United States between 1540 and 1542. Vázquez de Coronado had hoped to reach the Cities of Cíbola, often referred to now as the mythical Seven Cities of Gold. His expedition marked the first European sightings of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River, among other landmarks. His name is often Anglicized as Vasquez de Coronado or just Coronado. == Early life == Vázquez de Coronado was born into a noble family in Salamanca, Spain, in 1510 as the second son of Juan Vázquez de Coronado and Isabel de Luján. Juan Vázquez held various positions in the administration of the recently captured Emirate of Granada under Íñigo López de Mendoza, its first Christian governor. Francisco Vázquez de Coronado went to New Spain (present-day Mexico) in 1535 at about age 25, in the entourage of its first Viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, the son of his father's patron and Vázquez de Coronado's personal friend. In New Spain, he married twelve-year-old Beatriz de Estrada, called ""the Saint"" (la Santa), sister of Leonor de Estrada, ancestor of the de Alvarado family and daughter of Treasurer and Governor Alonso de Estrada y Hidalgo, Lord of Picón, and his wife Marina Flores Gutiérrez de la Caballería, from a converso Jewish family. Vázquez de Coronado inherited a large portion of a Mexican encomendero estate through Beatriz and had eight children by her. == Expedition == === Preparation === Vázquez de Coronado was the Governor of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia (New Galicia), a province of New Spain located northwest of Mexico and comprising the contemporary Mexican states of Jalisco, Sinaloa and Nayarit. In 1539, he dispatched Friar Marcos de Niza and Estevanico (more properly known as Estevan), one of only four survivors of the Narváez expedition, on an expedition north from Compostela toward present-day New Mexico. When de Niza returned, he told of a city of vast wealth, a golden city called Cíbola, whose Zuni residents were assumed to have murdered Estevan. Though he did not claim to have entered the city of Cíbola, he mentioned that it stood on a high hill and that it appeared wealthy and as large as Mexico City. Vázquez de Coronado assembled an expedition with two components. One component carried the bulk of the expedition's supplies, traveling via the Guadalupe River and Gulf of California under the leadership of Hernando de Alarcón. The other component traveled by land, along the trail on which Friar Marcos de Niza had followed Esteban. Vázquez de Coronado and Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza invested large sums of their own money in the venture. Mendoza appointed Vázquez de Coronado the commander of the expedition, with the mission to find the mythical Seven Cities of Gold. This is the reason he pawned his wife's estates and was lent 70,000 pesos. In the autumn of 1539, Mendoza ordered Melchior Díaz, commander of the Spanish outpost at San Miguel de Culiacán, to investigate Friar de Niza's findings, and on November 17, 1539, Díaz departed for Cíbola with fifteen horsemen. At the ruins of Chichilticalli, he turned around because of ""snows and fierce winds from across the wilderness"". Díaz had encountered Vázquez de Coronado before he had departed San Miguel de Culiacán, and reported that initial investigations into Friar de Niza's report disproved the existence of the bountiful land he had described. Díaz's report was delivered to Viceroy Mendoza on March 20, 1540. === Expedition === Vázquez de Coronado set out from Compostela on February 23, 1540, at the head of a much larger expedition composed of about 400 European men-at-arms (mostly Spaniards), 1,300 to 2,000 Mexican Indian allies, four Franciscan friars (the most notable of whom were Juan de Padilla and the newly appointed provincia",1,1,5,1
14,what season did lana lang leave smallville?,Sixth.,Smallville - Season 8,"Lana Lang is a fictional character on the television series Smallville. She has been a series regular since the pilot episode, and has been played continuously by Kristin Kreuk, with two other actresses having portrayed Lana Lang as a child and as an elderly woman. The character of Lana Lang, first created for comic books by Bill Finger and John Sikela in the 1950s as a romantic interest for Superboy, was adapted to television in 2001 by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the Smallville television series, none of which directly continues from or into the television episodes. In Smallville, Lana is the first main love interest for Clark Kent, though, in the first season she is dating Whitney Fordman. By season two, with Whitney's departure, Lana and Clark begin to grow closer. Clark's dishonesty over the secrets he is hiding causes their relationship to end. Lana then grows closer to Lex Luthor, whom she marries and divorces in the sixth season. Eventually Lana learns the truth about Clark and they get back together. After stealing a kryptonite-powered suit from Lex, Lana absorbs an enormous amount of kryptonite radiation, which prohibits her from getting too close to Clark, and she leaves Smallville for good, but vowed to continue to use her powers to preserve life. Initially, Lana is characterized as the intelligent ""girl next door"". She eventually becomes a tragic figure in Smallville, as the decisions made by Clark and Lex change the character over the course of the show. As Gough explains, by the end of the sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own game. Over the course of the show, Lana transitions from the girl next door to a more ""self-reliant young woman"". Kreuk has been nominated for various awards for her portrayal of Lana Lang. == Role in Smallville == In the first season, Lana and Clark Kent (Tom Welling) are just beginning their friendship, as she is a popular cheerleader dating star quarterback Whitney Fordman (Eric Johnson), and Clark cannot get near her without getting sick from the kryptonite necklace she wears. In the pilot episode, when her parents are killed in the first meteor shower, Lana (Jade Unterman) is adopted by her aunt Nell (Sarah-Jane Redmond). As the first season progresses, Lana grows closer to Clark, while Whitney begins to distance himself because of his father's medical ailments. In season two's episode ""Heat"" Lana sends Whitney, who left Smallville for the Marines in the season one finale, a video message breaking up with him. Lana's aunt Nell moves to Metropolis with her fiancé in the season two episode ""Ryan"", but Lana opts to move in with her friend Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) so that she may finish high school in Smallville. By the end of season two, Lana and Clark slowly try and start a romantic relationship, but fear backlash from Chloe because of her personal feelings for Clark. Just as the two give in to their feelings fully, Clark unexpectedly runs away from Smallville in the season two finale. At the start of season three, it is shown that Lana, alongside the Kents, has been spending her time searching for Clark; she ultimately finds him in Metropolis thanks to Chloe's help. Clark's actions in Metropolis force the two to rethink their relationship in the season three episode ""Phoenix"", and Lana eventually begins a new relationship with Adam Knight (Ian Somerhalder), whom she met while in physical therapy after being trampled by a horse in season three's ""Asylum"". By the season three episode ""Crisis"", it is discovered that the relationship Adam attempted to form with Lana was just a ploy so that Adam could investigate Clark. Season three's ""Forsaken"" reveals that Lana, in order to move on with her life, applies and is admitted into a program to study in Paris, France. Season four shows that Lana, while in Paris, began a romantic relationship with Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles). At the beginning of seas",1,1,5,4
15,what kind of equipment did isaac newton use?,"You don't know. 

Isaac Newton primarily used his mind and basic laboratory equipment during his time at Cambridge University. His work was more theoretical than experimental.",Reflecting telescope,"Robert Hooke (; 18 July 1635 – 3 March 1703) was an English polymath who was active as a physicist (""natural philosopher""), astronomer, geologist, meteorologist and architect. He is credited as one of the first scientists to investigate living things at microscopic scale in 1665, using a compound microscope that he designed. Hooke was an impoverished scientific inquirer in young adulthood who went on to become one of the most important scientists of his time. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, Hooke (as a surveyor and architect) attained wealth and esteem by performing more than half of the property line surveys and assisting with the city's rapid reconstruction. Often vilified by writers in the centuries after his death, his reputation was restored at the end of the twentieth century and he has been called ""England's Leonardo [da Vinci]"". Hooke was a Fellow of the Royal Society and from 1662, he was its first Curator of Experiments. From 1665 to 1703, he was also Professor of Geometry at Gresham College. Hooke began his scientific career as an assistant to the physical scientist Robert Boyle. Hooke built the vacuum pumps that were used in Boyle's experiments on gas law and also conducted experiments. In 1664, Hooke identified the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. Hooke's 1665 book Micrographia, in which he coined the term cell, encouraged microscopic investigations. Investigating optics – specifically light refraction – Hooke inferred a wave theory of light. His is the first-recorded hypothesis of the cause of the expansion of matter by heat, of air's composition by small particles in constant motion that thus generate its pressure, and of heat as energy. In physics, Hooke inferred that gravity obeys an inverse square law and arguably was the first to hypothesise such a relation in planetary motion, a principle Isaac Newton furthered and formalised in Newton's law of universal gravitation. Priority over this insight contributed to the rivalry between Hooke and Newton. In geology and palaeontology, Hooke originated the theory of a terraqueous globe, thus disputing the Biblical view of the Earth's age; he also hypothesised the extinction of species, and argued hills and mountains had become elevated by geological processes. By identifying fossils of extinct species, Hooke presaged the theory of biological evolution. == Life and works == === Early life === Much of what is known of Hooke's early life comes from an autobiography he commenced in 1696 but never completed; Richard Waller FRS mentions it in his introduction to The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S., which was printed in 1705. The work of Waller, along with John Ward's Lives of the Gresham Professors, and John Aubrey's Brief Lives form the major near-contemporaneous biographical accounts of his life. Hooke was born in 1635 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, to Cecily Gyles and the Anglican priest John Hooke, who was the curate of All Saints' Church, Freshwater. Robert was the youngest, by seven years, of four siblings (two boys and two girls); he was frail and not expected to live. Although his father gave him some instruction in English, (Latin) Grammar and Divinity, Robert's education was largely neglected. Left to his own devices, he made little mechanical toys; seeing a brass clock dismantled, he built a wooden replica that ""would go"". Hooke's father died in October 1648, leaving £40 in his will to Robert (plus another £10 held over from his grandmother). At the age of 13, he took this to London to become an apprentice to the celebrated painter Peter Lely. Hooke also had ""some instruction in drawing"" from the limner Samuel Cowper but ""the smell of the Oil Colours did not agree with his Constitution, increasing his Head-ache to which he was ever too much subject"", and he became a pupil at Westminster School, living with its master Richard Busby. Hooke quickly mastered Latin, Greek and Euclid's Elements; he also learnt to play the organ and began his

Calvin and Hobbes is a daily American comic strip created by cartoonist Bill Watterson that was syndicated from November 18, 1985, to December 31, 1995. Commonly described as ""the last great newspaper comic"", Calvin and Hobbes has enjoyed enduring popularity, influence, and academic and even a philosophical interest. Calvin and Hobbes follows the humorous antics of the title characters: Calvin, a mischievous and adventurous six-year-old boy; and his friend Hobbes, a sardonic tiger. Set in the suburban United States of the 1980s and 1990s, the strip depicts Calvin's frequent flights of fancy and friendship with Hobbes. It also examines Calvin's relationships with his long-suffering parents and with his classmates, especially his neighbor Susie Derkins. Hobbes's dual nature is a defining motif for the strip: to Calvin, Hobbes is a living anthropomorphic tiger, while all the other characters seem to see Hobbes as an inanimate stuffed toy, though Watterson has not clarified exactly how Hobbes is perceived by others, or whether he is real or an imaginary friend. Though the series does not frequently mention specific political figures or ongoing events, it does explore broad issues like environmentalism, public education, and philosophical quandaries. At the height of its popularity, Calvin and Hobbes was featured in over 2,400 newspapers worldwide. In 2010, reruns of the strip appeared in more than 50 countries, and nearly 45 million copies of the Calvin and Hobbes books have been sold worldwide. == History == === Development === Calvin and Hobbes was conceived when Bill Watterson, while working in an advertising job he detested, began devoting his spare time to developing a newspaper comic for potential syndication. He explored various strip ideas but all were rejected by the syndicates. United Feature Syndicate finally responded positively to one strip called The Doghouse, which featured a side character (the main character's little brother) who had a stuffed tiger. United identified these characters as the strongest and encouraged Watterson to develop them as the center of their own strip. Though United Feature ultimately rejected the new strip as lacking in marketing potential, Universal Press Syndicate took it up. === Launch and early success (1985–1990) === The first Calvin and Hobbes strip was published on November 18, 1985 in 35 newspapers. The strip quickly became popular. Within a year of syndication, the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers and proved to have international appeal with translation and wide circulation outside the United States. Although Calvin and Hobbes underwent continual artistic development and creative innovation over the period of syndication, the earliest strips demonstrated a remarkable consistency with the latest. Watterson introduced all the major characters within the first three weeks and made no changes to the central cast over the strip's 10-year history. By April 5, 1987, Watterson was featured in an article in the Los Angeles Times. Calvin and Hobbes earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988. He was nominated another time in 1992. The Society awarded him the Humor Comic Strip Award for 1988. Calvin and Hobbes has also won several more awards. As his creation grew in popularity, there was strong interest from the syndicate to merchandise the characters and expand into other forms of media. Watterson's contract with the syndicate allowed the characters to be licensed without the creator's consent, as was standard at the time. Nevertheless, Watterson had leverage by threatening to simply walk away from the comic strip. This dynamic played out in a long and emotionally draining battle between Watterson and his syndicate editors. By 1991, Watterson had achieved his goal of securing a new contract that granted him legal control over his creation and all future licens

Physics is a branch of science in which the primary objects of study are matter and energy. These topics were discussed by philosophers across many cultures in ancient times, but they had no means to distinguish causes of natural phenomena from superstitions. The scientific revolution of the 17th century, especially the discovery of the law of gravity, began a process knowledge accumulation and specialization that gave rise to the field of physics. Mathematical advances of the 18th century gave rise to classical mechanics and the increased used of the experimental method lead new understanding of thermodynamics. In the 19th century, the basic laws of electromagnetism and statistical mechanics were discovered. Physics was transformed by the discoveries of quantum mechanics, relativity, and atomic theory at the beginning of the 20th century. Physics today may be divided loosely into classical physics and modern physics. Detailed articles on specific topics are available through the Outline of the history of physics. == Ancient history == Elements of what became physics were drawn primarily from the fields of astronomy, optics, and mechanics, which were methodologically united through the study of geometry. These mathematical disciplines began in antiquity with the Babylonians and with Hellenistic writers such as Archimedes and Ptolemy. Ancient philosophy, meanwhile, included what was called ""Physics"". === Greek concept === The move towards a rational understanding of nature began at least since the Archaic period in Greece (650–480 BCE) with the Pre-Socratic philosophers. The philosopher Thales of Miletus (7th and 6th centuries BCE), dubbed ""the Father of Science"" for refusing to accept various supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural phenomena, proclaimed that every event had a natural cause. Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is the basic element, experimenting with the attraction between magnets and rubbed amber and formulating the first recorded cosmologies. Anaximander, developer of a proto-evolutionary theory, disputed Thales' ideas and proposed that rather than water, a substance called apeiron was the building block of all matter. Around 500 BCE, Heraclitus proposed that the only basic law governing the Universe was the principle of change and that nothing remains in the same state indefinitely. He, along with his contemporary Parmenides were among the first scholars to contemplate on the role of time in the universe, a key concept that is still an issue in modern physics. During the classical period in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in Hellenistic times, natural philosophy developed into a field of study. Aristotle (Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης, Aristotélēs) (384–322 BCE), a student of Plato, promoted the concept that observation of physical phenomena could ultimately lead to the discovery of the natural laws governing them. Aristotle's writings cover physics, metaphysics, poetry, theater, music, logic, rhetoric, linguistics, politics, government, ethics, biology and zoology. He wrote the first work which refers to that line of study as ""Physics"" – in the 4th century BCE, Aristotle founded the system known as Aristotelian physics. He attempted to explain ideas such as motion (and gravity) with the theory of four elements. Aristotle believed that all matter was made of aether, or some combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. According to Aristotle, these four terrestrial elements are capable of inter-transformation and move toward their natural place, so a stone falls downward toward the center of the cosmos, but flames rise upward toward the circumference. Eventually, Aristotelian physics became popular for many centuries in Europe, informing the scientific and scholastic developments of the Middle Ages. It remained the mainstream scientific paradigm in Europe until the time of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. Early in Classical Greece, k",1,1,3,1

Black soldiers served in mostly integrated units at this time. The First Rhode Island Regiment is the most famous regiment that included African Americans during the American Revolution. In 1778 the Rhode Island Assembly voted to allow ""every able-bodied negro, mulatto, or Indian man slave in this state to enlist into either of the Continental Battalions being raised."" The assembly further stipulated that ""every slave so enlisting shall, upon his passing muster before Colonel Christopher Greene, be immediately discharged from the service of his master or mistress, and be absolutely free."" Rhode Island Enslavers opposed this new law and in June 1778, the state repealed this provision. However, 100 African Americans enlisted during that four month period. Another 44 enlisted after June of 1778. In the end 144 African Americans enlisted in the First Rhode Island out of a total of 225.

Breadcrumb 10 Facts: Black Patriots in the American Revolution Soldiers at the siege of Yorktown, including a black soldier from the 1st Rhode Island Regiment. From a watercolor drawing in the diary of Jean Baptiste Antoine de Verger, an officer in Rochambeau's army during the American campaigns of 1780-81. Anne S.K. Brown Military Collection, Brown University Library Fact #1: Numbers in the Overall Population. At the onset of the War for Independence, approximately 500,000 African Americans lived in the colonies, of whom some 450,000 (90 percent) were enslaved. Blacks fought in provincial regiments prior to the war, and roughly 5,000 African American soldiers and sailors, free and slave, served the Revolutionary cause. While accurate numbers are hard to come by, the American population at the time was approximately 2.1 million; free blacks comprised 2.4 percent of the overall population, and slaves formed 21.5 percent. Fact #2: They Served from First to Last. Black Soldiers in the Continental Army and states' militia fought in every major battle of the war, and in most, if not all of the lesser actions. The same was not true of the Crown forces during the conflict. On April 19, 1775, Massachusetts militiamen of color, free and enslaved, along with their white comrades opposed British troops during the operations intended to seize American arms that ended in a harried retreat to the safety of Boston. Blacks served in Minute companies, as well as the normal embodied militia. To date, we have the names of 35 black men present that day, at least 18 seeing combat. One, Prince Estabrook, was wounded while with Captain John Parker's company on Lexington Green. Historian John Hannigan notes that, given incomplete records, it is likely that as many as 40 to 50 African Americans were with the militia on the war's first day. Three black veterans will serve to represent their many comrades. Former Pennsylvania private soldier Stacey Williams enlisted in April 1777, and served until autumn 1783. During that time, he was present at most, perhaps all, of the actions his regiment fought in: Short Hills, June 26, 1777; Brandywine, September 11, 1777 (where he was wounded); Germantown, October 4, 1777; the Darby Expedition, December 22-28, 1777; Monmouth, June 28, 1778; Bull's Ferry Block House, July 20-21, 1780; Green Spring, July 6, 1781; Yorktown, September 28 to October 18, 1781. Williams' military travels took him from West Point, New York, in the north, to Charleston, South Carolina, on foot the entire way. Virginian Andrew Pebbles (self-described as ""a poor unlearned Mulatto""), enlisted in the 11th Virginia Regiment in 1778, and later served with Lee's Legion. At the battle of Eutaw Springs, ""he received three wounds ... in the shoulder slightly, lost the thumb of the left hand and was bayonetted in the belly."" Pebbles was discharged from the army in August 1782. Another man, who experienced the Valley Forge winter camp, as well as the battles of Red Bank, Monmouth, Rhode Island, and Yorktown, merely noted in his pension testimony, ""I Prosper Gorten (a man of colour) ... say that in the Month of June ... 1777 I enlisted as a private soldier in Capt Flaggs Company in Colonel Christopher Greens regiment ... in the Rhode Island line In which service I continued untill the 15 June 1783 when I recivd a regular discharge signed by George Washington which discharge is hereto annexed."" Fact #3: The Continental Army and Most States' Militia were Integrated. Barring a few units, the Continental army and states' militia were integrated forces, with enlisted white Europeans, African Americans, and Native Americans serving side by side. There is evidence of Black soldiers in the ranks during the three-year War of 1812, but the War of the Revolution was the last instance of wide-spread U.S. military integration until President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 in July 1948. In October 1775, General William Heath described the American army surrounding British-held Boston: ""There are in the Massachusetts Regiments Some few Lads and Old men, and in Several Regiments, Some Negroes. Such is also the Case with the Regiments from the Other Colonies, Rhode Island has a Number of Negroes and Indians, Connecticut has fewer Negroes but a number of Indians. The New Hampshire Regiments have less of Both. The men from Connecticut I think in General are rather stouter than those of either of the other Colonies. But the Troops of our Colony are Robust, Agile, and as fine Fellows in General as I ever would wish to see in the Field."" Two years later a German officer wrote of the American Revolutionary forces, 'The negro can take the field in his master's place; hence you never see a regiment in which there are not a lot of negroes, and there are well-built, strong, husky fellows among them."" And Baron Ludwig von Closen, aide-de-camp to French General Rochambeau, wrote in July 1781, ""I had a chance to see the American Army, man for man. It was really painful to see these brave men, almost naked, with only some trousers and little linen jackets, most of them without stockings, but, would you believe it, very cheerful and healthy in appearance."" That August he added, ""It is incredible that soldiers composed of men of every age, even children of fifteen, of whites and blacks, unpaid, and rather poorly fed, can march so well and withstand fire so steadfastly."" Fact #4: Early-War Attempts at Barring Black Service. Shortly after the creation of the New England Army of Observation (precursor of the Continental Army), attempts were made to restrict or bar African Americans from serving as soldiers. In May 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial legislature resolved, ""that no slaves be admitted into this army upon any consideration whatever."" Five months later, New Jersey resident Richard Smith told of Congressional deliberations, ""Tuesday 26 Septr. Comee. brought in a Letter to Gen Washington, in the Course of it E[dward] Rutledge [of South Carolina] moved that the Gen. shall discharge all the Negroes as well Slaves as Freemen in his Army, he (Rutledge) was strongly supported by many of the Southern Delegates but so powerfully opposed that he lost the Point."" After much discussion, on November 12, General Washington directed, ""Neither Negroes, Boys unable to bare Arms, nor old men unfit to endure the fatigues of the campaign, are to be inlisted."" Among the officers defending Black soldiers, Massachusetts Brigadier General John Thomas stands out. He wrote in October 1775, in the ""Regiments at Roxbury, the Privates are Equal to any that I Served with Last war, very few Old men, and in the Ranks very few boys ... we have Some Negros, but I Look on them in General Equally Servicable with other men, for Fatigue and in Action; many of them have Proved themselves brave."" Signaling a change of policy, at the end of December, the Commander-in-Chief told of ""Numbers of Free Negroes [who] are desirous of inlisting,"" giving ""leave to the recruiting Officers to entertain them."" (As a side note, African Americans were never evicted from the army and continued to serve during the eight-month paper exercise of deciding if they should be soldiers or not.) Given the desperate need to fill Continental regiments, Washington's decree was generally adopted and the American army remained a racially integrated organization to the war's end. Fact #5: Black Americans' Motivations for Enlisting. Black Americans' reasons for joining the Continental Army often mirrored those of their fellow white and Native American soldiers. Many fought for national independence and hoped for opportunities in the new country. Some, perhaps many, joined for the adventure of military service, sometimes connected to the prospect of serving alongside family or friends. Others were at least partly enticed by the lure of an enlistment bounty or regular pay. Furthermore, after the ideals espoused in the Declaration of Independence, some fought for their own freedom, or for that of their loved ones. Forced service was another factor. If they were on the militia rolls, both white and Black men periodically faced the chance of being drafted for a short-term stint in a Continental regiment. Whites were occasionally compelled to enlist, but enslaved African Americans were more often coerced or forced by their masters to serve. Many enslaved Africans, especially in New England, were promised freedom in return for military service; most of those promises were honored, but some veterans were kept in bondage. The major dividing line between white and Black common soldiers was the American system that enslaved ninety percent of the country's African Americans and treated free blacks as second-class citizens. Despite that, Black Continental soldiers largely received the same considerations as their white comrades. At the most basic level, soldiers of color (both African and Native Americans) received the same pay, provisions, clothing, and equipment as white soldiers. Regarding all these things, both whites and soldiers of color suffered together in times of scarcity and jointly enjoyed the rare times of bounty. The most glaring case of unequal treatment was that Black soldiers were largely barred from serving in any rank other than drummer, fifer, or private soldier. Furthermore, in the early war years, they seem to have occasionally been given labor details more often than white soldiers, but that ended by the conflict's middle years. In the end, there may have been difficulties due to officers' or fellow soldiers' personal or race animus, but current research shows that such instances were few and far between. Fact #7: A Black Regiment. In 1775, Virginia Governor John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, on his own, formed the Ethiopian Regiment with freed slaves. That unit was disbanded after one year, and in March 1777, British Commander-in-Chief in America, Sir William Howe, directed that ""all Negroes, Mollattoes, and other Improper Persons who have been admitted into [Loyalist] Corps be immediately discharged."" On the ""rebel"" side, New Jerseyan Jonathan Dickinson Sergeant suggested raising a regiment of freed slaves, and sent the plan to John Adams in August 1776. Adams replied, ""Your Negro Battalion will never do. S. Carolina would run out of their Wits at the hint of such a measure."" When South Carolinian and aide to General George Washington, John Laurens, suggested manumitted slaves be used to form a regiment in his home state, his father Henry succeeded in moving the resolution in the Continental Congress, only to have it resoundingly defeated. In an army with predominantly integrated units, the segregated 1st Rhode Island Regiment was one of the few exceptions. The 1st Rhode Island began in 1777, as an integrated regiment, having African American and Native Americans in the ranks, alongside white soldiers. Early in 1778, the white Rhode Island private soldiers in both of the state's regiments were transferred to the 2nd Regiment. Additionally, the 1st Regiment command staff was sent to Rhode Island to fill that unit with newly-freed slaves of African and Native American descent. At the same time, a company of veteran Black soldiers was formed back at Valley Forge. Belonging to the 1st Rhode Island, that veteran company formed and fought alongside the 2nd Regiment during the June 1778 Monmouth campaign and battle. The 1st Regiment as a whole saw action at the August 1778 Battle of Rhode Island. The 1st Rhode Island Regiment existed as a segregated regiment (filled with Black and Native American private soldiers, but commanded by white officers, sergeants, and corporals) from February 1778 to July 1780, only two years and five months. Formed into five companies in 1778, in 1779, it was reduced to four companies. Having been severely diminished in manpower, in July 1780, the remaining men were formed into two large companies and attached to a six-month state regiment. During its entire service as a segregated unit, barring one brief foray into Connecticut, the 1st Rhode Island remained in their home state. In January 1781, the remaining two companies marched to New York, where they were combined with the men of the 2nd Regiment to form a single Rhode Island Regiment. That unit contained seven companies manned by white private soldiers, and two large companies manned by Black and Native American soldiers. In September 1781, Black soldiers formed 29 percent of the regiment. The Rhode Island Regiment served at the Yorktown siege, and in 1782, were sent to northern New York. The remnants of the Rhode Island troops, formed into two companies (one all white, the other integrated) were discharged in November 1783. A third segregated regiment served in the war, the French Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue (1779-1783), which enlisted both free and enslaved Blacks. Their first action was at the Siege of Savannah, in autumn 1779. Fact #8: Black Continental Soldier Numbers. Despite the generally accepted estimate that 5,000 Black soldiers and seamen served the cause of Independence, accurate numbers are hard to ascertain. The August 24, 1778, ""Return of Negroes in the Army"" tallied numbers of Black soldiers in fifteen brigades of General George Washington's main army. The result was 755 African Americans in a force totaling almost 21,000 rank and file (corporals and private soldiers), plus drummers and fifers; Black soldiers comprised 3.63 percent of the whole. While that document did not include regiments from Rhode Island, New Jersey, South Carolina, or Georgia, it does provide us with a snapshot of Black soldier numbers at a specific time and place. We can add the soldiers of African heritage serving in the four New Jersey regiments (about 10), as well as those in the segregated 1st Rhode Island Regiment (188), which brings the August 1778 total to 953 black Continentals. One much-cited eye-witness actually gives a false impression of black numbers. In July 1781, Baron Ludwig von Closen, aide-de-camp to French General Rochambeau, wrote of the Continental Army near White Plains, New York, ""A quarter of [Washington's army] were negroes, merry, confident, and sturdy."" Twenty-five percent of the 4,200 troops present (all New England regiments) would mean they included 1,050 Black soldiers. Given a probable increase in Black soldier numbers in the war's later years, but considering the August 1778 proportion of 3.63 percent, it is more likely the July 1781 proportion was closer to 8 to 10 percent. In fact, we do not know if Closen saw the entire American force or just a portion of it, which would have skewed his estimate. Finally, Baron von Closen's observational accuracy is suspect; on July 9, 1781, he remarked that, ""Three quarters [75 percent] of the Rhode Island regiment consists of negroes,"" when, based on unit returns, Black soldiers actually formed 29 percent of that regiment. Fact #9: Some Slaves Served as Soldiers. Most states had Continental and militia soldiers serving who were still enslaved or had been freed from slavery in return for military service. The best-known instances of the latter were the enslaved Rhode Island African and Native Americans who received their freedom upon joining the state's 1st Regiment in spring 1778. In Massachusetts, slave-soldiers served from the war's first day, and in that state, as well as Connecticut, many, but not all, enslaved men who enlisted were emancipated by their owners. Historian John Hannigan notes one case, ""On June 15, 1776, Pomp Jackson, a slave, owned by prominent Newburyport merchant Jonathan Jackson, enlisted in Colonel Edmund Phinney's Regiment. Four days later, Jonathan manumitted Pomp, offering as his reasons 'the impropriety I feel... in beholding any person in constant bondage--more especially at a time when my country is so warmly contending for the liberty every man ought to enjoy...' Although the manumission document does not make an explicit connection between Pomp Jackson's enlistment and his subsequent freedom, the timing of the two events only four days apart can hardly be coincidental. In November 1776, Pomp Jackson reenlisted for the duration of the war and served as a fifer in Colonel Joseph Vose's Regiment until his discharge in June 1783."" Many states had laws barring slaves from military service, but enslaved men still enlisted, involuntarily or of their own choice. Virginia had such a law, but enslaved men still served, either passing as freedmen, or at their owner's bidding. In one instance, an intoxicated white Virginia farmer, Rolling Jones, was induced to enlist. Regretting his action when sober, he sent his slave Tim in his place. Tim Jones (taking his master's last name) served with the 3rd Virginia Regiment, seeing action at the Battle of Camden and the Yorktown siege, where he ""lost his leg by a musket ball."" He ""was given his freedom by the Country for the faithful discharge of his duty as a soldier."" Virginia slave-soldiers were recognized in October 1783, when the legislature passed ""An act directing the emancipation of certain slaves who have served as soldiers in this state."" The law attempted to redress slaveowners' wrongs, declaring that ""many persons in this state had caused their slaves to enlist in certain ... corps ... as substitutes for free persons ... at the same time representing to ... recruiting officers that the slaves so enlisted ... were freemen ... that on expiration of the term of enlistment of such slaves that the former owners have attempted again to force them to return to a state of servitude, contrary to the principles of justice, and to their own solemn promise."" Since those slaves had ""contributed towards the establishment of American liberty and independence, [they] should enjoy the blessings of freedom as a reward for their toils and labours."" As a result, the men in question were to be ""fully and compleatly emancipated, and shall be held and deemed free in as full and ample a manner as if each and every of them were specially named in this act."" It is not known how diligent the government was in finding the slaves concerned, nor how many were freed as a result. Fact #10: In an Army with Many Female Followers, Some Were Women of Color. To correct a popular belief, no matter their skin color, women with the army were required to be respectable, and to perform useful tasks to earn army rations. Those who did not conform were not long tolerated. Among the many unknown women who served, we know the identities of several. Sarah, a mulatto slave, was, with her six-year-old light-haired son, attached to the 1st Maryland Regiment for several months in 1778. That October, they left the unit to escape being re-enslaved; we only know of them because of a runway advertisement. Hannah Till and her husband Isaac were enslaved members of General George Washington's military household. Hannah, a cook, gave birth to a son at the Valley Forge winter camp, and in late 1778, she purchased her freedom. Her entire term of service lasted from 1776 to at least 1780. Hannah and her family lived in Philadelphia after the war. Judith Lines was a free Black woman. In July 1781, she married John Lines, a soldier in the 5th Connecticut Regiment. In 1782, she joined her husband's regiment in their camp in New York's Hudson Highlands. During her several months stay, she worked as a servant for the unit's commander, but caught the smallpox and spent some weeks recovering from that illness. Having several children from an earlier marriage, back at home, she was sole caretaker of the family and farm. The details of Judith's life are available to us via her husband's nineteenth century pension file, which includes a letter sent her by John in November 1781. Success!

As a member of the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA), he won championships in 2009 and 2010 and was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011. In high school, Odom received national player of the year honors from Parade in 1997. He played college basketball for the University of Rhode Island, earning all-conference honors during his only season in the Atlantic 10 Conference before turning professional. The Los Angeles Clippers selected Odom with the fourth overall pick in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team in the following year; it was during his four seasons with the Clippers, however, that he was twice suspended for violating the league's anti-drug policy. As a restricted free agent, he then signed with the Miami Heat, where he played the 2003–04 season before being traded to the Lakers. Odom spent seven seasons with the Lakers, who traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. After the move, his career declined. He was traded back to the Clippers in 2012 and played briefly in Spain in 2014. Odom played on the United States national team, winning a bronze medal in the Olympics in 2004 and a gold medal in the FIBA World Championship (later known as the World Cup) in 2010. Odom was married to Khloé Kardashian from 2009 to 2016. During their marriage, Odom made several appearances on the reality television show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. He and Kardashian also had their own reality series, Khloé & Lamar. In October 2015, Odom was hospitalized in a comatose state after being discovered unconscious in a Nevada brothel. He later sought treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. == Early life == Odom was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York City, to Joe Odom and Cathy Mercer. His father was a heroin addict. His mother died of colon cancer when he was only 12 years old. On her deathbed, she reportedly told him: ""Be nice to everybody."" Odom was afterwards raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer. In his first three years of high school, Odom played for Christ the King Regional High School in Middle Village, Queens. He left the school at the start of his senior year due to poor grades, transferring first to Redemption Christian Academy in Troy, New York, and then to the now-defunct St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New Britain, Connecticut, where he was coached by Jerry DeGregorio. As a senior, Odom was recognized nationally as the Parade Player of the Year in 1997. Among other distinctions, he earned USA Today All-USA First Team honors and was named to the Parade All-American First Team for the second consecutive year. While still in high school, Odom played on the same AAU team as future NBA teammates Elton Brand and Ron Artest (later known as Metta World Peace); he also played at the Adidas ABCD Camp with future Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant. Adidas executive Sonny Vaccaro commented at the time that Odom possessed a ""$2 million smile"". == College career == Though he considered entering the NBA directly from high school and consulted Kobe Bryant as a player who had made that jump, Odom ultimately decided that he was not ready and committed to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas instead. However, a Sports Illustrated story questioning the validity of his ACT score and an arrest for soliciting prostitution provided the school cause enough to revoke his scholarship, and for this reason, he never played for the Runnin' Rebels. To the university's further embarrassment, an investigation by the NCAA would later reveal that Odom had received $5,600 in illicit payments from one of its boosters, resulting in the firing of Coach Bill Bayno and UNLV being placed on probation for four years. Odom transferred to the University of Rhode Island, with the cost of his room and board being covered by funds his father received from the G.I. Bill. Since he was ad

18,where did frank baum die?,Hollywood.,Hollywood,"Lyman Frank Baum was born May 15, 1856 in Chittenango, New York. His education consisted of being tutored at home and attending Peekskill Military Academy, Peekskill, New York, for two years. From 1878 to 1883 he was an actor and playwright. Baum wrote, produced and acted in his own plays touring as far West as Kansas. After marrying Maud Gage in 1881, he worked as a traveling salesman selling axle grease and other products manufactured by the family business, Baum's Castorine. Baum and his wife moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota in 1888 where Baum opened a variety store called Baum's Bazaar. Due to a depression and drought, the store failed in 1890. Undaunted, Baum quickly started the Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer. As editor, he used his imagination to create the column called ""Our Landlady"" who ""commented on all things going on in Aberdeen."" Baum was also known for his evening story telling time with the local children. Unfortunately, the paper failed in 1891 and the Baum's next moved to Chicago. He again worked as a traveling salesman, this time for a china-ware company. He also wrote stories for several newspapers. At the urging of his mother-in-law, he wrote his first book, ""Mother Goose in Prose"" in 1897. This book launched his career and he went on to write many books for children, young adults and adults both under his own name and seven pseudonyms. The most famous of Baum's work is ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."";Countless children's letters urged him to write 13 more Oz titles during his lifetime. The Oz series has been loved and enjoyed by many generations. It is believed that Baum's description of Kansas in the Wizard of Oz is really based on his experiences in South Dakota. Historians and scholars have discovered much about L. Frank Baum's early life and literary works by studying his imaginative editorials and writings in the Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer and the years he spent in South Dakota. L. Frank Baum passed away on May 16, 1919 at his home,"" Ozcot"" in Hollywood, California. He is buried in the family plot at Forest Lawn, Glendale, California.

Maud Gage Baum (née Gage; March 27, 1861 – March 6, 1953) was the wife of American children's publisher L. Frank Baum. Her mother was the suffragist Matilda Joslyn Gage. In her early life, she attended a boys' high school. Maud lived in Fayetteville, New York, with her aging parents until she married Frank in 1882, sacrificing her college education at Cornell University. At the onset of their marriage, she accompanied her husband's acting troupe throughout the United States. After she became pregnant, Maud and Frank settled down in a rented house, where she gave birth to Frank Joslyn in 1883. Complications arising from giving birth to her second son Robert Stanton in 1886 caused Maud to become afflicted with peritonitis. Ill for two years, she found solace in visiting her mother and siblings. In 1889 and 1891, she gave birth to Harry Neal and Kenneth Gage, respectively. Described by her children as a no-nonsense mother, Maud took charge of the family finances and the disciplining of her children. She was their primary caretaker because her husband's business obligations frequently led to his being away for weeks at a time. The family moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota, in 1888 because Maud wished to be near her brother and two sisters. After her husband was unable to sustain a living there, they moved to Chicago. Because of their dire financial situation, Maud also worked, teaching embroidery and lace-making. Beginning in 1900, her husband's best-selling picture book, Father Goose: His Book (first published in 1899), brought the family financial security that it had theretofore lacked. They began spending their summers at a cottage in Macatawa Park, Michigan. In November of that year, Frank transferred to Maud the literary rights of his most recent books, including Father Goose and From Kansas to Fairyland (later published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). By dint of Frank's literary successes, Maud and Frank were financially secure enough to tour Egypt and Europe for six months. Since Frank was frequently occupied with penning stories for his publishers, Maud was the one who wrote numerous letters home. These letters were later published in 1907 as In Other Lands Than Ours for friends and family. After Frank died, she authorized Ruth Plumly Thompson to write more Oz sequels and helped promote MGM's film The Wizard of Oz (1939). In 1953, she died at 91 years of age, surviving her husband by 34 years. == Early life == Born on March 27, 1861 to Matilda Joslyn Gage and Henry Hill Gage Maud was the youngest of their four children. She had two sisters, Helen Leslie Gage and Julia Gage Carpenter, and a brother, Thomas Clarkson Gage. Her mother was a feminist who fought for women's rights, and her father was a prosperous dry-goods retailer. A relative noted that Maud's mother was a ""woman of force"" who ""ruled her mild, gentle husband and her four children with a rod of iron"". Maud lived with her parents in a Greek Revival home in Fayetteville, New York. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz wrote that Maud had ""dark hair, a shapely figure, and eyes as sharp as her mind"". In her youth, Maud went to a boys' high school. Both she and her future husband, L. Frank Baum, attended Syracuse Classical School, a preparatory school in Syracuse, New York. In September 1880, Maud headed to Cornell University, leaving on a train and arriving at an Ithaca depot two hours later. Her brother, Clarkson, had graduated as one of the top of the class, though her elder sisters did not attend a university. When Maud arrived at the university, she intended to be the family's first woman to receive a complete degree. Her mother dreamed of her becoming a doctor or a lawyer, which would be a rare accomplishment for a woman. Though Maud had very little knowledge about being on her own, she was not timid. When she entered the parlor of her dormitory on her first day there, she recognized a tune from the piano. Telling the girls around her that ""I dearly love dancing"", Mau

Lyman Frank Baum (; May 15, 1856 – May 6, 1919) was an American author best known for his children's fantasy books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, part of a series. In addition to the 14 Oz books, Baum penned 41 other novels (not including four lost, unpublished novels), 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book became a landmark of 20th-century cinema. Born and raised in Chittenango, New York, Baum moved west after an unsuccessful stint as a theater producer and playwright. He and his wife opened a store in South Dakota and he edited and published a newspaper. They then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a newspaper reporter and published children's literature, coming out with the first Oz book in 1900. While continuing his writing, among his final projects he sought to establish a film studio focused on children's films in Los Angeles, California. His works anticipated such later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work). == Childhood and early life == Baum was born in Chittenango, New York, in 1856 into a devout Methodist family. He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (née Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. ""Lyman"" was the name of his father's brother (Lyman Spaulding Baum), but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name ""Frank"". His father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New York. Baum was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two years at Peekskill Military Academy, but after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly psychogenic heart attack and was allowed to return home. Baum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap printing press. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of The Rose Lawn Home Journal. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they gave to family and friends for free. By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called The Stamp Collector, printed an 11-page pamphlet called Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory, and started a stamp dealership with friends. At 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding poultry. He specialized in raising the Hamburg chicken. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, The Poultry Record and, in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs. Baum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the Fourth of July memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as Santa Claus for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life. == Career == === Theater === Baum embarked on his lifetime infatuation—and wavering financial success—with th",1,1,1,1
19,which country won the crimean war?,Russia lost the Crimean War.,Russian Empire,"In February and March 2014, Russia invaded the Crimean Peninsula, part of Ukraine, and then annexed it. This took place in the relative power vacuum immediately following the Revolution of Dignity. It marked the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The events in Kyiv that ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych on 22 February 2014 sparked pro-Russian and anti-separatism demonstrations in Crimea. At the same time, Russian president Vladimir Putin discussed Ukrainian events with security chiefs, remarking that ""we must start working on returning Crimea to Russia"". On 27 February, Russian special forces without insignia seized strategic sites across Crimea. Although Russia at first denied its military involvement, Putin later admitted that troops were deployed to ""stand behind Crimea's self-defence forces"". As Russian troops occupied Crimea's parliament, it dismissed the Crimean government, installed the pro-Russian Aksyonov government, and announced a referendum on Crimea's status. The referendum was held under Russian occupation and, according to the Russian-installed authorities, the result was overwhelmingly in favor of joining Russia. The next day, 17 March 2014, Crimea's authorities declared independence and requested to join Russia. Russia formally incorporated Crimea on 18 March 2014 as the Republic of Crimea and federal city of Sevastopol. Following the annexation, Russia built up its military presence on the peninsula and warned against any outside intervention. Ukraine and many other countries condemned the annexation and consider it to be a violation of international law and Russian agreements safeguarding the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The annexation led to the other members of the G8 suspending Russia from the group and introducing sanctions. The United Nations General Assembly also rejected the referendum and annexation, adopting a resolution affirming the ""territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders"", and referring to the Russian action as a ""temporary occupation"". The Russian government opposes the ""annexation"" label, with Putin defending the referendum as complying with the principle of the self-determination of peoples. == Other names == === In Ukraine === The names of the Crimean annexation vary. In Ukraine, the annexation is known as the temporary occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol by Russia (Ukrainian: тимчасова окупація Автономної Республіки Крим і Севастополя Росією, romanized: tymchasova okupatsiia Avtonomnoi Respubliky Krym i Sevastopolia Rosiieiu), the illegal occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the fall of Crimea, and the invasion of Crimea. === In Russia === In the Russian Federation, it is also known as the accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation (Russian: присоединение Крыма к Российской Федерации, romanized: prisoyedineniye Kryma k Rossiyskoy Federatsii), the return of Crimea (Russian: возвращение Крыма, romanized: vozvrashcheniye Kryma), and the reunification of Crimea. == Background == Crimea was part of the Crimean Khanate from 1441 until it was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1783 by a decree of Catherine the Great. After the downfall of Russian empire in 1917 during the first stages of the Russian Civil War there were a series of short-lived independent governments (Crimean People's Republic, Crimean Regional Government, Crimean SSR). They were followed by White Russian governments (General Command of the Armed Forces of South Russia and later South Russian Government). In October 1921, the Bolshevik Russian SFSR gained control of the peninsula and instituted the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic as a member of Russian Federation. In the following year Crimea joined the Soviet Union as a part of Russia (the RSFSR). After the Second World War and the 1944 deportation of all of the indigenous Crimean Tatars by the Soviet government, the Crimean ASSR was stripped of its autonomy in

Explore the National Park Service Exiting nps.gov Contact Us The Crimean War On March 28, 1854, Great Britain and France declared war on Russia, joining the Ottoman Empire in a conflict that became known as The Crimean War. European powers had not fought a major war against each other since the Napoleonic Wars which ended in 1815. The Crimean War was an imperial war fought on many fronts, including modern day Ukraine, the Baltic Seas, and the Kamchatka Peninsula of East Asia. During the war, modern weaponry and new mass media technologies, such as steamships and telegraphy heightened the intensity of the conflict and brought details of the war rapidly to the global public. Many of the British Royal Marines stationed at English Camp were veterans of the Crimean War. The Crimean War lasted from 1854 until 1856 and encompassed trench warfare, amphibious assaults, and naval blockades. The primary center of the conflict was in Central Asia, including areas in Ukraine that are now embroiled in conflict, where the Russian Empire fought an alliance of Ottoman, English, and French forces. The official cause of the war was a dispute between the Russian Czar, Nicholas I and the Ottoman Emperor, Abdulmejid I, over which empire would have authority over Orthodox Christians living in Ottoman territory. This religious dispute was a pretext for European powers to project power against each other. At the time the war began in October of 1853, the Ottoman Empire's Western European allies were concerned with Russian imperial expansion and viewed this religious and political disagreement as an opportunity to check Russian expansion through superior military force. The Ottoman Empire, which had recently lost territories in Western Europe to nationalist revolutions believed that with the support of the more powerful French and British imperial militaries they could reinvigorate their empire and secure their borders. Thought the argument over religious freedom was the reason this global war broke out, the reasons the world's most powerful nations chose to fight this war were imperial rivalries and territorial expansion. The Crimean War was one of the first truly modern wars. New technologies, such as railways, telegraphs, and steamships, which did not exist during the Napoleonic Wars enabled the combatants to rapidly deploy forces into numerous theaters of combat. Military firepower had also significantly advanced by the time of the Crimean War and soldiers in the field faced down artillery barrages unlike those that their predecessors had faced. Works of literature, such as ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, evoke the senseless slaughter that British forces (and all combatants) faced during this conflict. Florence Nightingale became an international celebrity for the capable and timely assistance she gave to injured soldiers who prior to her intervention faced unsanitary and deplorable conditions in improvised field hospitals. The Crimean War ended a mere 3 years before the Pig War conflict. British Columbia Governor James Douglas had played a role in the conflict in North America and Asia, while many Royal Marines later stationed at English Camp fought on the frontlines. The US military sent observers to examine the battlefield tactics and new technologies utilized by combatants, which greatly informed the strategies used during the Civil War. The horror of this conflict and the desire to avoid another modern war undoubtedly informed British and American decision making during the Pig War.

The Outcome of the Crimean War On 30th March 1856, the Crimean War was formally brought to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Paris... Jessica Brain 11 min read On 30th March 1856, the Crimean War was formally brought to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. This formal recognition signed at the Congress of Paris came after Russia accepted a humiliating defeat against the alliance of Britain, France, the Ottoman Empire and Sardinia. The treaty itself would address Russian expansionism, quashing dreams of a Russian empire equal to none, whilst at the same time confirming the importance of the Ottoman Empire in maintaining a very tentative balance of power in Europe. The Crimean War which had begun in October 1853 lasted eighteen months and in that time had escalated into a series of fragmented battles and sieges, causing huge loss of life and highlighting wider issues and failures pertaining to leadership, military intervention, mortality rates, medicine and mismanagement. The war itself garnered a great deal of attention and proved to be a significant and defining moment for Europe. It was first and foremost the embodiment of a 'modern war', using new technologies that would later characterise the wars of the next century. Furthermore, the coverage of the war in newspapers, particularly in Britain allowed the general public to experience the horrors of war in a new and provocative way, thanks to reporting by the likes of William Howard Russell for The Times newspaper. This overseas reporting combined with information from significant figures such as Florence Nightingale, would paint an extremely unfavourable picture leading to demands for reforms. Florence Nightingale Whilst the Treaty of Paris marked an important step, with all sides recognising the need for a peaceful solution, the logistics of competing interests in negotiations made it more difficult to put into practice. The main agreement did manage to create some tangible guidelines which included forcing Russia to demilitarise the Black Sea. This agreement was between the Tsar and the Sultan who maintained that no arsenal could be established on the coastline. For Russia this clause in particular proved to be a major blow, weakening its power base as it no longer could threaten the Ottoman Empire via its navy. This was thus an important step in scaling down the potential for escalating violence. In addition, the treaty agreed the inclusion of the Ottoman Empire into the Concert of Europe which was essentially a representation of the balance of power on the continent, instigated back in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna. As part of this, the European powers promised to comply with its independence and not compromise any Ottoman territory. Russia on the other hand was forced to return the city of Kars and all other Ottoman territory which it had taken into its possession. The principalities of Wallachia and Moldovia were thus returned as Ottoman territory, later granted independence and eventually turned into modern-day Romania. Russia was forced by the treaty to abandon its claim of a protectorate for Christians living in the Ottoman Empire, thus discarding the very premise which engaged Russia in war in the first place. In exchange, the alliance of powers agreed to restore the towns of Sevastpol, Balaklava, Kerch, Kinburn and many other areas back to Russia which had been occupied by the Allied troops during the war. A major consequence of this agreement was the reopening of the Black Sea for international trade and commerce. The importance of resuming trade was a major consideration for all involved, so much so that an international commission was created on the premise of establishing a free and peaceful navigation of the Danube River for the purpose of commerce. 'Le Congres de Paris' by Edouard Louis Dubufe Apart from resuming trade, the countries involved were forced into a period of reflection; with an unhappy general public, high death toll and little to show for it, leaders needed to show they were willing to make changes. This was particularly pertinent for Russia which suffered terribly, losing around 500,000 of its troops. The Crimean War thus instigated an era of self-evaluation in Russia which threw off the shackles of archaic traditions and embraced modernisation. Upon the death of Nicholas I, Alexander II became Tsar, who by comparison was liberal in his views and approach. A wave of reforms followed with the momentous decision to abolish serfdom and address issues such as its failing economy. It was at this moment that Russia would embark into a new age where educated elites would pause in a moment of retrospection, unleashing as they did so an era of creativity characterised by the great figures of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Russia took its defeat as an opportunity to resolve internal problems. Meanwhile, Crimea was significant for Britain as it marked one of its first military interventions in Europe for forty years. The repercussions for Westminster would be massive as the portrayal of the war in British media allowed the public for the first time to receive information day-by-day about the carnage abroad. Information that many would have wanted to keep quiet was available, the needless tragedy of the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade resonated strongly with a disaffected British population. The Crimean War had ended favourably for Britain and members of its fellow alliance, however its unpopularity had led to a change of leader with the Earl of Aberdeen being forced to resign via a no confidence vote in 1855. The new Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston was the preferred choice. With the increased accessibility of information and more awareness of foreign policy, the people would demand peaceful solutions. As part of this new change under Palmerston's government, an inquiry was launched in order to investigate the disastrous set of events. The report concluded that the government had been responsible for not allowing adequate supplies as well as blaming senior members of the Armed forces for certain delays. The investigation also made important headway with the evolution of modern nursing practices, prompted by the work of Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole who individually were improving the sanitation levels of field hospitals at Crimea. Lessons were there to be learnt for all governments; people were dissatisfied with leadership and a new approach needed to be found. The Treaty of Paris forced nations to address issues both internal and external. France and Britain would remain committed to reinforcing and stabilising the Ottoman Empire as much as possible in order to restore balance. This would be hard to achieve, especially with the rising tide of nationalism in Ottoman territory which threatened the Empire's very existence. The inclusion of the Ottoman Empire into the sphere of European influence was seen as essential for solving the ""eastern question"", however, the Treaty of Paris did little to address this conundrum. The treaty simply affirmed Turkey's crucial role in European peace but was not able to prevent conflict from ensuing once more. The Ottoman Empire would eventually fall in 1914. More widely, the Crimean War saw the balance of power change hands in Europe. Whilst Russia suffered a major defeat, Austria, which had chosen to remain neutral, would find itself in the coming years at the mercy of a new rising star, Germany. Under the leadership of Bismarck, who took advantage of fraught relations, new strategy for survival emerged. Austria would end up uniting with Hungary in a monarchical empire. Meanwhile, Sardinia, a participant in the alliance at Crimea would intervene in Italian affairs, ensuring that a united nation of Italy would emerge out of the territorial chasms of Europe. Traditional empires were now under threat, with Britain and France sensing the urgency and need to maintain a grip on affairs. The Crimean War highlighted how difficult it was to keep a balance of power in Europe. The end of the war resulted in a new era of relations, a new way of doing things; the old traditional empires stretched over continents gave way in Europe to the nation-state. Change was coming.

20,who formed the american federation of labor?,Samuel Gompers,Samuel Gompers,"Formation of the American Federation of Labor The American Federation of Labor (A.F. of L. or AFL) was founded on December 8, 1886. Its predecessor, the Federation of Organized Trade and Labor Unions (FOTLU), was formed by members of the Knights of Labor (KOL) and labor leaders including Samuel Gompers. Following the Haymarket affair on May 4, 1886, FOTLU and trade union leaders convened in Columbus, Ohio in December of that year. They announced the formation of the A.F. of L., with Samuel Gompers becoming its first and longest serving president.1 In the following decades, the American Federation of Labor became the largest federation of labor unions in the United States. Unfortunately, it largely excluded unions with high percentages of minority workers with the notable exception of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Also, it was not particularly friendly toward industrial unions, leading those unions to leave the A.F. of L. and form the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). However, the two entities would eventually merge to form the AFL-CIO in December of 1955. Finding Aid Letterpress books containing correspondence of Samuel Gompers and William Green, presidents of the American Federation of Labor. Other letters are signed by James Duncan, Gabriel Edmonston, Frank K. Foster, and John McBride. Finding Aid Part I consists of general correspondence, subject files, and personal papers of the brotherhood's founder, A.

McLaurin (international field organizer), A. Philip Randolph (founder and president), and Ashley L. Totten (secretary-treasurer), and other subject files, financial records, and miscellaneous records. The records of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) span the years 1883-1925 and consist of letterpress volumes of correspondence of Samuel Gompers (1850-1924) and William Green (1870-1952), presidents of the organization, and by other officials including James Duncan, Gabriel Edmonston, Frank Keyes Foster, and John McBride. Comprising approximately 172,300 items (328,445 images) digitized from previously produced microfilm, the collection relates to the formation of local unions, meetings, charters, bylaws, ethics, publicity, arbitration, AFL's political principles, communism, socialism, anthracite coal strikes of 1897 and 1902, fund-raising, boycotts, and the United Mine Workers, American Railway Union, International Association of Machinists, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and American Federationist, the AFL's magazine. This guide highlights those special collections at the Library that would be of interest to researchers studying business and labor history with an emphasis on personal and organizations papers and related resources. Samuel Gompers (Samuel Gumpertz) spent his early years as a cigar maker. The family immigrated to the United States in 1863 and settled in New York City. Father and son continued in the cigar trade and Samuel joined the Cigar Makers Local Union. In his mid-twenties Gompers was elected president of the local Cigar Makers' International Union where he continued working his way up through the union ranks. In 1881, he helped found the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions which became the American Federation of Labor (A. F. of L. or AFL). He became its first president and served as such for most of the rest of his life. The first Labor Day holiday was celebrated on Tuesday, September 5, 1882 at the behest of the Central Labor Union. The Central Labor Union pushed other organizations to follow and by 1894 23 other states had adopted the holiday. On May 4, 1886, a bomb detonates near Haymarket Square in Chicago after police arrive to break up a rally in support of striking workers. This protest is one of a number of strikes, demonstrations, and other events held by workers and their supporters in Chicago from May 1-4 to advocate for an eight hour workday. The information in this guide focuses on primary source materials found in the digitized historic newspapers from the digital collection Chronicling America. Internet Resources In 2013 the AFL-CIO named the University of Maryland Libraries their official repository for records of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), selected records of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and the merged American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). In terms of dates, it covers 1881 to 1955. More specifically it contains the George Meany Memorial AFL-CIO Archive which is approximately 40 million documents and the AFL-CIO Merger Oral History Project collection. It also includes staff oral histories that explore the history of the 1955 merger of the AFL and the CIO.

37d. American Federation of Labor Poster announcing American Federation of Labor President Samuel Gompers' visit to Ouray, Colorado, in 1899 Keeping it Simple Keep it simple. That was the mantra of labor leader Samuel Gompers. He was a diehard capitalist and saw no need for a radical restructuring of America. Gompers quickly learned that the issues that workers cared about most deeply were personal. They wanted higher wages and better working conditions. These ""bread and butter"" issues would always unite the labor class. By keeping it simple, unions could avoid the pitfalls that had drawn the life from the National Labor Union and the Knights of Labor. Samuel Gompers was born in London in 1850 to a family of Jewish cigarmakers. Coming to Manhattan at the height of the American Civil War, the Gompers family maintained that trade. An effective organizer and speaker, Gompers became the head of the local cigarmakers' union at the age of only twenty-seven. A Union for the Skilled In December of 1886, the same year the Knights of Labor was dealt its fatal blow at Haymarket Square, Gompers met with the leaders of other craft unions to form the American Federation of Labor. The A.F. of L. was a loose grouping of smaller craft unions, such as the masons' union, the hatmakers' union or Gompers's own cigarmakers' union. Every member of the A.F. of L. was therefore a skilled worker. Gompers had no visions of uniting the entire working class. Tradespeople were in greater demand and already earned higher wages than their unskilled counterparts. Gompers knew that the A.F. of L. would have more political and economic power if unskilled workers were excluded. He served as president of the union every year except one until his death in 1924. Although conservative in nature, Gompers was not afraid to call for a strike or a boycott. The larger A.F. of L. could be used to support these actions, as well as provide relief for members engaged in a work stoppage. By refusing to pursue a radical program for political change, Gompers maintained the support of the American government and public. By 1900, the ranks of the A.F. of L. swelled to over 500,000 tradespeople. Gompers was seen as the unofficial leader of the labor world in America. Simplicity worked. Although the bosses still had the upper hand with the government, unions were growing in size and status. There were over 20,000 strikes in America in the last two decades of the 19th century. Workers lost about half, but in many cases their demands were completely or partially met. The A.F. of L. served as the preeminent national labor organization until the Great Depression when unskilled workers finally came together. Smart leadership, patience, and realistic goals made life better for the hundreds of thousands of working Americans it served. Gompers, et al. v. Buck's Stove & Range Company Samuel Gompers was found in contempt of court for violating an injunction related to boycotting Buck's Stove & Range Company. The case was finally heard by the United States Supreme Court which reversed the decision. Here is the full text of the high court's decision. Joseph Labadie: Anarchist and Labor Agitator One of early labor's most influential activists, the Detroit anarchist involved himself in an astounding array of social reform movements: Knights of Labor, Socialist Labor Party, Greenbackism, the eight-hour-day movement, Haymarket defense effort, single tax movement, and American Federation of Labor.

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) is a national trade union center that is the largest federation of unions in the United States. It is made up of 60 national and international unions, together representing more than 12 million active and retired workers. The AFL-CIO engages in substantial political spending and activism, typically in support of progressive and pro-labor policies. The AFL-CIO was formed in 1955 when the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations merged after a long estrangement. Union membership in the US peaked in 1979, when the AFL-CIO's affiliated unions had nearly twenty million members. From 1955 until 2005, the AFL-CIO's member unions represented nearly all unionized workers in the United States. Several large unions split away from AFL-CIO and formed the rival Change to Win Federation in 2005, although a number of those unions have since re-affiliated, and many locals of Change to Win are either part of or work with their local central labor councils. The largest unions currently in the AFL-CIO are the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) with approximately 1.7 million members, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), with approximately 1.4 million members, and United Food and Commercial Workers with 1.2 million members. == Membership == The AFL-CIO is a federation of international labor unions. As a voluntary federation, the AFL-CIO has little authority over the affairs of its member unions except in extremely limited cases (such as the ability to expel a member union for corruption and enforce resolution of disagreements over jurisdiction or organizing). As of May 2023, the AFL-CIO had 60 member unions representing 12.5 million members. == Political activities == The AFL-CIO was a major component of the New Deal Coalition that dominated politics into the mid-1960s. Although it has lost membership, finances, and political clout since 1970, it remains a major player on the liberal side of national politics, with a great deal of activity in lobbying, grassroots organizing, coordinating with other liberal organizations, fund-raising, and recruiting and supporting candidates around the country. In recent years the AFL-CIO has concentrated its political efforts on lobbying in Washington and the state capitals, and on ""GOTV"" (get-out-the-vote) campaigns in major elections. For example, in the 2010 midterm elections, it sent 28.6 million pieces of mail. Members received a ""slate card"" with a list of union endorsements matched to the member's congressional district, along with a ""personalized"" letter from President Obama emphasizing the importance of voting. In addition, 100,000 volunteers went door-to-door to promote endorsed candidates to 13 million union voters in 32 states. == Governance == The AFL-CIO is governed by its members, who meet in a quadrennial convention. Each member union elects delegates, based on proportional representation. The AFL-CIO's state federations, central and local labor councils, constitutional departments, and constituent groups are also entitled to delegates. The delegates elect officers and vice presidents, debate and approve policy, and set dues. === Annual meetings === From 1951 to 1996, the Executive Council held its winter meeting in the resort town of Bal Harbour, Florida. The meeting at the Bal Harbour Sheraton has been the object of frequent criticism, including over a labor dispute at the hotel itself. Citing image concerns, the council changed the meeting site to Los Angeles. However, the meeting was moved back to Bal Harbour several years later. The 2012 meeting was held in Orlando, Florida. === State and local bodies === The AFL-CIO constitution permits international unions to pay state federation and central labor council (CLC) dues directly, rather than have each local or state federation pay them. This relieves each union's state and local a",1,1,5,5
21,what team does jordan own?,Charlotte Hornets,Jordan national football team,"Top Stories Michael Jordan's decision to sell Hornets leaves some team decisions in flux With the NBA's Board of Governors unlikely to approve the sale until at least another month, how should Charlotte approach the upcoming Draft and free agency period? Steve Reed | The Associated Press June 17, 2023 4:28 PM Michael Jordan plans to keep a minority stake in the Hornets, the team he bought in 2010 for about $275 million. CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The timing of Michael Jordan's decision to sell his majority ownership stake in the Charlotte Hornets has left the organization in flux, with several looming key personnel decisions. The Hornets have the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft on Thursday night. They also have some difficult decisions to make in free agency in early July, including whether to re-sign embattled restricted free-agent Miles Bridges. With the NBA's Board of Governors unlikely to approve the team's sale to an ownership group led by Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall until at least another month or two, the question becomes who'll sign off on general manager Mitch Kupchak's potentially franchise-altering decisions this summer? Will it be Jordan, a lame duck majority owner? Or will the new ownership have a major input? Jordan will remain on as a minority owner after the sale is approved, so he still has a vested interest in the organization. Bobby Marks, a front office insider for ESPN, said the timing of the announcement makes this a unique situation. ""Whether it's Mitch or Michael making the decisions, I think you have to keep these guys from the new ownership group in the loop,"" Marks said. ""... At the end of the day, they don't technically have a say in anything yet, but I would think they have to be part of the conversation, particularly when it comes to taking on future money."" But Marks said the trade rumors swirling around the New Orleans Pelicans potentially being open to moving former No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson in order to secure the second or third pick in the draft complicates things for the Hornets. Essentially, would a trade that has long-lasting implications sit well with new ownership? ""If they have a chance to move out of the two spot, what happens when you have salary involved that stretches past this year, which means money out of their pockets? I would think you would want to get (the new ownership group's) blessing before taking on money like that,"" Marks said. ESPN commentator Jeff Van Gundy agrees. ""I would suspect there would be conversations about who they want to draft and sign before anything is finalized,"" Van Gundy said. Both Marks and Van Gundy believe the toughest decision ahead involves whether or not to re-sign Bridges. A former first-round pick out of Michigan State, Bridges had a breakout season in 2021-22. He led the team in scoring and rebounding and appeared on the verge of a huge pay day last summer before felony domestic violence charges put his career on hold. The 25-year-old Bridges wound up pleading no contest to the charges and agreed to three years probation. He missed all of last season. The NBA ultimately determined Bridges will serve a 10-game suspension once he returns to the league. The league officially suspended him for 30 games, but determined 20 games of the suspension have already been served because Bridges already missed all 82 games in 2022-23. ""In terms of the new owners you have to wonder, is that what you want your first signing to be?"" Marks said. Added Van Gundy: ""There is more to that (decision) than just basketball."" Van Gundy believes the Hornets are in good hands in terms of personnel decisions with longtime NBA general manager Mitch Kupchak at the helm. He believes both Jordan and the new owners will rely heavily upon his opinion moving forward during this time of transition. As a player, Jordan was a six-time NBA Finals MVP, a 14-time All-Star and a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He's in the conversation as the greatest basketball player of all-time. But he never approached that level of success as an owner. The Hornets were 423-600 in his 13 years as majority owner and never won a playoff series. Charlotte has failed to reach the playoffs seven straight seasons, the longest drought in the NBA. Still, Van Gundy said he was surprised when reports first surfaced that Jordan was looking to sell the team. ""He always looked to be a hands-on owner,"" Van Gundy said. ""I know he has the fishing and the auto racing that he's involved in, but I still didn't expect him to get out of the NBA. And yet he looks like he is going to make a tidy profit, so good for him."" Jordan purchased the team for $275 million in 2010 and will sell it for a reported $3 billion. ""You win with Michael Jordan the player,"" Van Gundy added. ""Those type of players will make you elite for a long time. You see it with (Nikola) Jokic. It's hard to get those players, and when you do you are set up for a long period of time. ... But the Hornets, they missed on a few high draft picks."" After finishing 7-59 in the 2011-12 season, the Hornets failed to land the No. 1 pick in the lottery and missed out on star center Anthony Davis. Charlotte settled for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist at No. 2, passing on Bradley Beal and Damion Lillard. The Hornets also selected Cody Zeller fourth overall in 2013 instead over Giannis Antetokounmpo and Steven Adams, and swung and missed on top 10 picks Frank Kaminsky and Noah Vonleh in 2014 and 2015. ""It's about the roster, the roster, the roster,"" Van Gundy said. ""The most important person in every organization is the person who picks the players.""

Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ, is an American businessman and former professional basketball player. He played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon. His profile on the NBA website states, ""By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."" Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames ""Air Jordan"" and ""His Airness"". Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. He returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999, returning for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards. He was selected to play for the United States national team during his college and NBA careers, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated. Jordan's individual accolades include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, 10 All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game). He is one of only eight players to achieve the basketball Triple Crown. In 1999, Jordan was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (""The Dream Team""). He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a ""Dream Team"" member in 2017. Jordan was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996 and to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. The trophy for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award is named in his honor. One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular. Jordan starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film Space Jam (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. Jordan is also a co-o",1,1,5,3
22,what was dr seuss's real name?,Theodor Seuss Geisel,Theodor Robert Geisel,"Celebrating Dr. Seuss As a child, I remember that the first children's book I read was by Dr. Seuss. Many children, including myself, first learned to read books by Dr. Seuss. His illustrations were eye-catching, and the titles of his stories were creative and memorable. Dr. Seuss's full name was Theodore ""Ted"" Seuss Geisel. He was born on March 2nd, 1904. Geisel was an author, political cartoonist, illustrator, poet, animator, screenwriter, and filmmaker. He wrote more than 60 children's books and had a major impact on society. This month we should pay tribute to a man who had a major influence on children's literature. Ted Geisel's Early Life & Education Geisel was born in Springfield, Massachusetts to Henrietta and Theodore Geisel. His father owned and managed a brewery, but due to the Prohibition movement, it was permanently closed. In 1931, Geisel's father, Theodore, was hired to supervise Springfield's public parks. Theodore would often take his son to Springfield Zoo located within the parks. The zoo was a major part of Ted's childhood. Geisel enjoyed drawing pictures of the animals at the zoo. If his father couldn't take him, he would often go with his mother or sister. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, and became close friends with the students in his graduating class. He graduated in 1925, and then decided to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy in English Literature. At the time, he had wanted to become a professor. While at Oxford, he met Helen Palmer, who he later married in 1927. She persuaded him to pursue drawing as a career, and to give up becoming a Philosophy professor. Geisel dropped out of Oxford without earning a degree and returned to the United States. Career as a Cartoonist At the beginning of World War II, Geisel began illustrating political cartoons for PM Magazine. His cartoons often would depict satirical illustrations of major historical figures. In 1943, Ted boarded a train to California and joined the U.S. army. Ted was deployed to the Fox Studios in Hollywood to serve as a political cartoonist during the war effort. He worked with Frank Capra's Signal Corps to create animated training films and draw propaganda posters for the Treasury Department and the War Production Board. Career in Children's Books Geisel published more than 60 children's books. His first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, was published in 1937, after being rejected 27 times. Other works of his included, The Cat in the Hat, published in 1957, Green Eggs and Ham, published in 1960, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, also published in 1960, Horton Hears a Who, published in 1962, and Oh, the Places You'll Go, published in 1990.

Horton Hears a Who! (also known as Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who! or simply Horton) is a 2008 American animated adventure comedy film based on the 1954 book of the same name by Dr. Seuss, produced by Blue Sky Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The film was directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino, from a screenplay written by the writing team of Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. It stars the voices of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell as Horton the Elephant and Mayor Ned McDodd, respectively, alongside Carol Burnett, Will Arnett, Seth Rogen, Dan Fogler, Isla Fisher, Jonah Hill, and Amy Poehler. Recurring Blue Sky collaborator John Powell composed the film's musical score. It is the fourth screen adaptation of the book following the 1970 Chuck Jones television special, the 1987 Soviet animated short, and the 1992 Russian animated short. The film was released theatrically on March 14, 2008, to generally positive reviews, and grossed $298 million on a budget of $85 million. Horton Hears a Who! was the third Dr. Seuss feature film adaptation, the first adaptation to be fully animated using CGI technology, the first and so far only theatrical film adaptation to receive positive reviews, and the second Dr. Seuss film starring Jim Carrey after How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). == Plot == In the Jungle of Nool, Horton the Elephant, the jungle's eccentric nature teacher, hears a tiny yelp coming from a floating dust speck and gives chase to it before placing it on top of a flower. Horton finds out the speck harbors the city of Whoville and its inhabitants, the Whos, led by Mayor Ned McDodd, whose family includes his wife, Sally; 96 daughters whose names all begin with the letter H; and one teenage son named JoJo. Despite being the oldest child and next in line for the mayoral position, JoJo does not want to be the next mayor, and he does not speak due to his fear of disappointing his father. Once Horton begins carrying the speck with him, the city starts experiencing strange phenomena (earthquakes and changes in the weather), and the mayor finds his attempts to caution Whoville challenged by the town council, led by the opportunistic yet condescending chairman. After he makes contact with Horton, the mayor finds out from Dr. Mary Lou LaRue that Whoville will be destroyed if Horton does not find a safe location for the speck to reside. With the help of his best friend Morton the mouse, Horton decides to place the speck atop Mt. Nool, the safest place in the jungle. The head of the jungle, the Sour Kangaroo, who despises Horton for his lackadaisical influence on the children and subsequently ""pouch-schooling"" her son Rudy, demands numerous times that Horton give up the speck for overshadowing her authority, but Horton refuses. Also taking force toward Horton are the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys and lackeys to the Kangaroo who like to cause havoc around the jungle. Eventually, the Kangaroo, refusing to believe that the Whos exist, enlists a sinister but idiotic vulture named Vlad Vladikoff to get rid of the speck by force. After a few failed attempts, Vlad manages to steal the flower away from Horton and drops it into a massive field of identical pink flowers causing an apocalyptic tremor in Whoville. After unsuccessfully picking flowers all day, Horton eventually recovers the flower (exactly the 3,000,000th flower), also revealing himself to the rest of Whoville, who have largely survived. The Kangaroo eventually finds out that Horton still has the speck, fires Vlad, and rallies the jungle community into arresting Horton, preying on their fears that their own children will become chaotic delinquents under his influence. Upon cornering him, the Kangaroo offers Horton a final chance to renounce Whoville's existence. Horton refuses, and despite the heartfelt speech that he gives, the Kangaroo orders the animals to rope and cage him, and to have the speck and Whoville destroyed in a pot of beezlenut oil. The Mayor enlists a

Theodor Seuss Geisel ( sooss GHY-zəl, zoyss -⁠; March 2, 1904 – September 24, 1991) was an American children's author and cartoonist. He is known for his work writing and illustrating more than 60 books under the pen name Dr. Seuss ( sooss, zooss). His work includes many of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death. Geisel adopted the name ""Dr. Seuss"" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and as a graduate student at Lincoln College, Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, including for FLIT and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper PM. He published his first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street in 1937. During World War II, he took a brief hiatus from children's literature to illustrate political cartoons, and he worked in the animation and film department of the United States Army. After the war, Geisel returned to writing children's books, writing acclaimed works such as If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), Green Eggs and Ham (1960), One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish (1960), The Sneetches and Other Stories (1961), The Lorax (1971), The Butter Battle Book (1984), and Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990). He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including eleven television specials, five feature films, a Broadway musical, and four television series. He received two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children's Special for Halloween Is Grinch Night (1978) and Outstanding Animated Program for The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat (1982). In 1984, he won a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation. His birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an initiative focused on reading created by the National Education Association. == Life and career == === Early years === Geisel was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in his first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is near his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. The family was of Jewish descent. Geisel was raised as a Missouri Synod Lutheran and remained in the denomination his entire life. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925. At Dartmouth, he joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the humor magazine Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief. While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room. At the time, the possession and consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the Jack-O-Lantern. To continue working on the magazine without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name ""Seuss"". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his ""big inspiration for writing"" at Dartmouth. Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.) in English literature. At Oxford, he met his future wife Helen Palmer, who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career. She later recalled that ""Ted's notebooks were always fil

Lyman Frank Baum was born May 15, 1856 in Chittenango, New York. His education consisted of being tutored at home and attending Peekskill Military Academy, Peekskill, New York, for two years. From 1878 to 1883 he was an actor and playwright. Baum wrote, produced and acted in his own plays touring as far West as Kansas. After marrying Maud Gage in 1881, he worked as a traveling salesman selling axle grease and other products manufactured by the family business, Baum's Castorine. Baum and his wife moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota in 1888 where Baum opened a variety store called Baum's Bazaar. Due to a depression and drought, the store failed in 1890. Undaunted, Baum quickly started the Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer. As editor, he used his imagination to create the column called ""Our Landlady"" who ""commented on all things going on in Aberdeen."" Baum was also known for his evening story telling time with the local children. Unfortunately, the paper failed in 1891 and the Baum's next moved to Chicago. He again worked as a traveling salesman, this time for a china-ware company. He also wrote stories for several newspapers. At the urging of his mother-in-law, he wrote his first book, ""Mother Goose in Prose"" in 1897. This book launched his career and he went on to write many books for children, young adults and adults both under his own name and seven pseudonyms. The most famous of Baum's work is ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."";Countless children's letters urged him to write 13 more Oz titles during his lifetime. The Oz series has been loved and enjoyed by many generations. It is believed that Baum's description of Kansas in the Wizard of Oz is really based on his experiences in South Dakota. Historians and scholars have discovered much about L. Frank Baum's early life and literary works by studying his imaginative editorials and writings in the Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer and the years he spent in South Dakota. L. Frank Baum passed away on May 16, 1919 at his home,"" Ozcot"" in Hollywood, California. He is buried in the family plot at Forest Lawn, Glendale, California.",5,1,5,2

What Is The Capital Of Sri Lanka? Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is the administrative capital and seat of the national legislature and Colombo is the commercial center of Sri Lanka. Faced with the problem of congestion in the capital city of Colombo the government of Sri Lanka designated Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte as the country's administrative capital. Sri Lanka is one of the Asian countries with two capitals alongside South Korea. National Capitals Of Sri Lanka The two capitals of Sri Lanka represent the two largest urban areas in the country, with a combined population of over 800,000. While Colombo is an economic center in Sri Lanka and the greater South Asia, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte relieves Colombo of its congestion by housing government institutions. Colombo Colombo is a port city located in the southwestern part of the country. The city derives its principal significance due to its port, which is one of the largest human-made harbors in the world. It is also a major world port for both passenger and cargo ships.Colombo has a rich history as witnessed in its Dutch and British colonial style buildings. It has been an important port for traders throughout time, from Arab, Chinese, and Portuguese to Dutch. The city became the capital of the British Crown Colony of Ceylon in 1802 and capital of an independent Sri Lanka in 1948. As the chief economic center of the country, Colombo is home to industries such as gem-cutting, chemical manufacture, textile and clothing, cement, glass production, and food processing. Colombo handles most of the country's foreign trade and is home to the Insurance Corporation, Government corporations, World Trade Centre, and multiple multinational headquarters. Important government ministries and institutions are also located in the city such as the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; President's House; Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Defence; Air Force Headquarters; Prime Minister's Office and Naval Headquarters. Colombo is the most significant city in Sri Lanka, given its trade and commercial supremacy. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is the official capital city of Sri Lanka. Founded in the 14th Century, Sri Jayawardenepura served as the official capital of the Sinhalese Kingdom of Kotte up to the 16th century. The city was then occupied by the Portuguese who fortified the city and later moved to Colombo once overwhelmed by the continuous attacks from the neighboring Sitawaka Kingdom. The city was designated as the new capital in 1977, after the government outgrew the independence capital, Colombo. In 1982, the new parliament was inaugurated in the city and other ministries began filing in. Sri Jayawardenepura is the administrative capital of Sri Lanka, and more government institutions continue to be relocated to the city from Colombo. The city is also home to the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, one of the leading higher institutions in the country. Role Of The Two Capitals Of Sri Lanka In The Governance Of The Country Primarily, having two capitals was set to minimize traffic and population congestion in Colombo and thus minimize environmental damage due to congestion. Having two capitals in Sri Lanka enables the government to counter rapid urbanization and provide better infrastructure facilities. Sri Lanka's government aims for efficiency in governance, where Colombo is the commercial center and Sri Jayawardenepura is the center of administration.

Christianity is a minority religion in Sri Lanka. It was introduced to the island in first century. Traditionally, after Thomas the Apostle's visit in Kerala in AD 52, Christianity is said to have been introduced to Sri Lanka because of its close geographical and commercial ties. Records suggest that St. Thomas Christians and Nestorian Christians lived in Sri Lanka, and the Anuradhapura cross is one of the archaeological finds that suggest Christianity in Sri Lanka before the arrival of the Portuguese. Nestorian Christianity is said to have thrived in Sri Lanka with the patronage of King Dathusena during the 5th century. There are mentions of involvement of Persian Christians with the Sri Lankan royal family during the Sigiriya Period. Over seventy-five ships carrying Murundi soldiers from Mangalore are said to have arrived in the Sri Lankan town of Chilaw most of whom were Christians. King Dathusena's daughter was married to his nephew Migara who is also said to have been a Nestorian Christian, and a commander of the Sinhalese army. Maga Brahmana, a christian priest of Persian origin is said to have provided advice to King Dathusena on establishing his palace on the Sigiriya Rock. According to Leonard Pinto, this is not widely accepted as it is contrary to recorded Mahāvaṃsa textual sources on royal family from this period. The Anuradhapura Cross discovered in 1912 is also considered to be an indication of a strong Nestorian Christian presence in Sri Lanka between the 3rd and 10th century in the then capital of Anuradhapura of Sri Lanka. There were also conversions by the Dutch in the 17th century. The Christian population of Sri Lanka includes members of Burghers, Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups. == Catholicism == In the pre-colonial era, Nestorian Christians and St. Thomas Christians were both present in Sri Lanka. These two groups later established a union with the Catholic Church. After Yahballaha III, the Nestorians accepted union with the Catholic Church. Father Jordanus arrived in Sri Lanka in 1329 and Giovanni de Marignolli arrived as Papal Legate in 1348/49 to assist the Christians in the country. There were also Catholic travellers such as Odoric of Pordenone who visited Sri Lanka. Catholicism was formally introduced by the Portuguese in 1505. 6.19% of the population (1,261,194 persons) is Catholic, according to the 2012 census. Catholicism thus constitutes approximately 83.5% of the Christian population as of census day 2012. Catholicism was first introduced by the Portuguese, who left a notable mark in that Portuguese surnames are still used by many Catholics. Dutch missionaries tried to spread Protestantism after the Portuguese were expelled, but most Sri Lankan Christians are now Catholics. There is an archbishop and 11 other bishops. The dioceses are: Archdiocese of Colombo Diocese of Anuradhapura Diocese of Badulla Diocese of Batticaloa Diocese of Chilaw Diocese of Galle Diocese of Jaffna Diocese of Kandy Diocese of Kurunegala Diocese of Mannar Diocese of Ratnapura Diocese of Trincomalee == Protestantism == 290,967 persons in Sri Lanka (1.43%) are Protestants as per the 2012 census. The Ceylon Pentecostal Mission has about 16,500 church members and 70 churches (faith homes) in Sri Lanka. About 2000 people (1998) are affiliated with congregations belonging to the Baptist World Alliance. The Ceylon Evangelical Lutheran Church has about 5,000 members. The main Protestant churches in Sri Lanka are Anglican, Methodist, Baptist and Salvation Army. The Church of Ceylon is an extra-provincial Anglican church, and the Church of South India (a united church of Anglicans, Presbyterians, and other Protestants) is a full member of the Anglican Communion and has a diocese in Jaffna. The Anglican Church has a strong effect on people in some areas. Methodist missionaries established 187 schools of which only 2 remains (Wesley College and Methodist College) because all the other schools were taken over by the governm",2,1,3,5
24,what electorate does anna bligh represent?,South Brisbane,Electoral district of South Brisbane,"Following the declaration of Brisbane's Lord Mayor that he is running for state parliament at the next election, and will be the leader of the opposition for that campaign, there is a trope making the rounds that he is somehow ""unelected"". Out of curiosity, I decided to see how his numbers in the Brisbane City Council elections in 2008 stacked up against Anna Bligh's numbers in the 2009 state election. The internet being what it is, official sources for these numbers weren't too hard to dig up: I found the Lord Mayoral results on the Brisbane City Council site I found the Electorate of South Brisbane results on the Electoral Commission Qld site (with the preferences taken into account here). Results: Campbell Newman received 335,076 first preference votes for Lord Mayor (60% of the total). After distribution of preferences, he received a total of 339,320 votes (66% of the total). It's probably worth noting that the second placed candidate received 29% of the first round votes, increasing to 34% after distribution of preferences, so Newman actually did receive the majority of the remaining preferences, there just weren't many to go around. Anna Bligh received 12,243 first preference votes in her electorate of South Brisbane (48% of the total). After distribution of preferences, she received a total of 14,697 votes (65% of the total). So, our State Premier holds her position on the back of the support of her party and around 15k people living in or near South Brisbane. The new leader of the opposition will hold that position on the back of the support of his party and around 340k people living in the City of Brisbane. Since the current population of Qld is estimated at 4.5 million people, effectively 7.5% of the state voted for Newman to be Brisbane's Lord Mayor, while only 0.3% voted for Bligh to represent the seat of South Brisbane. And people are calling Newman an unelected leader? (Yes, I'm aware that the nature of parliamentary governments based on geographic representation means that most constituents don't get to vote directly for their parliamentary leaders. The only purpose of this post is to point out how dumb that makes the ""unelected"" gibe sound when it is aimed at the directly elected Lord Mayor of a city the size of Brisbane)

Bligh resigns after election wipe-out Exiting Queensland Premier Anna Bligh and husband Greg Withers during a press conference in Parliament House in Brisbane, March 25, 2012, where Ms Bligh announced she was resigning from her position as a the member for South Brisbane following the Liberal National Party's landslide election win, taking 78 out of 89 seats. (AAP: Dan Peled) abc.net.au/news/anna-bligh-resigns-from-parliament/3911416 Link copied Anna Bligh has announced she is standing aside as leader of the Queensland Labor party and resigning from Parliament after leading her party to its worst electoral defeat. ""I will be standing aside as the leader of the Labor Party and further I will be resigning as the member for South Brisbane,"" she said. ""Queensland has voted to close my era in Queensland politics."" Labor was swept from government after 14 years, as a huge swing towards the LNP saw the ALP lose all but seven of its seats. Ms Bligh said the loss was a ""devastating defeat"" for the ALP, and she felt the party could not look to rebuild with her in the Parliament. ""This is much more than a loss for Labor - it is without doubt a devastating defeat. The task for Labor is not to be consumed by that heartbreak,"" she said. The loudness and clarity of the message sent by the people of Queensland is unmistakable, and in fairness to Queenslanders I don't think I should ignore it. ""The task is to recover, to rebuild, to renew and to be everything that this enduring party has been for more than a century. ""It is not a task I believe can be achieved with me at the head of the team or as part of the team."" During the campaign Ms Bligh had said she would stay as the Member for South Brisbane no matter the final result, but she now says the scale of the defeat meant she did not feel she could continue in Parliament. ""I apologise to the people for South Brisbane for any inconvenience and difficulty that my decision today will cause them,"" she said. ""But when I took on the responsibilities of leadership and premier, I took on broader responsibilities that today I believe I have to rise to. ""The loudness of and clarity of the message sent by the people of Queensland is unmistakable, and in fairness to Queenslanders I don't think I should ignore it."" Her resignation takes effect on March 30, meaning the by-election could be held on the same day as upcoming local government elections. New leader Loading... Her decision to resign paves the way for the ALP to place a new leader in the Parliament. The landslide win culled the next generation of Labor leaders, including nine ministers, and left Labor without an obvious contender for opposition leader. Earlier former Labor premier Peter Beattie said Ms Bligh needed to stand aside to make way for an opposition leader. ""I think at some point, not now, Anna will need to make way for a future leader to be put into South Brisbane,"" he said. Mr Beattie says former Bligh ministers Cameron Dick or Andrew Fraser should look to take over the leadership. ""Look, I think Cameron Dick is clearly an incredibly good performer, so is Andrew Fraser. One of those has to be, in my view, put into South Brisbane,"" he said. Mr Dick only narrowly lost his Greenslopes seat, and says he has not ruled out a return to politics in the future. ""I do think I've perhaps got more to give to Queensland. It's been an extraordinary privilege to serve over the last few years and I think I've been able to demonstrate that I've got some of the skills and attributes that could help our state in the future,"" he said. But the outgoing education minister suggested Annastacia Palaszczuk could lead the Labor Party, and says it is a matter for the remaining MPs. ""I work closely with Annastacia Palaszczuk, who's one of the minister's that's continuing in the Opposition now and I think those ministers who've had experience in government should play a significant role in the Opposition,"" he said. ""But ultimately I'm very much a supporter of the traditions and history of our party and it will ultimately be the state parliamentary party who'll make that decision."" Trailblazing figure Irrespective of whoever leads the party into what is likely to be a long period in opposition, Ms Bligh says today marks the end of her time in politics. ""I think Queensland has very decisively closed the chapter on Anna Bligh's era in Queensland politics,"" she said. ""I think my time in public life after more than two decades is well and truly behind me."" Her resignation brings to an end a state political career that spans the best part of two decades. Queensland has very decisively closed the chapter on Anna Bligh's era in politics... My time in public life after more than two decades is well and truly behind me. Ms Bligh's first foray into politics began during her university days, with her involvement in the Student Union and Women's Rights Collective. She later worked in a number of community organisations, including childcare services, neighbourhood centres, women's refuges and trade unions as well as in the Queensland Public Service. Ms Bligh was first elected to parliament at the 1995 election to the safe Labor seat of South Brisbane. She was promoted to the ministry following the election of the Beattie government in 1998 as minister for families, and became Queensland's first female education minister in 2001. Four years later, the retirement of then deputy premier and treasurer Terry Mackenroth forced a cabinet reshuffle that saw Ms Bligh promoted to the office of deputy premier. Mr Beattie publicly endorsed her as his replacement when he announced his retirement from politics in September 2007. Ms Bligh then led Labor to victory in the 2009 state election, becoming Australia's first elected female premier. 'Get to work' Loading... Shortly after Ms Bligh announced her resignation, premier-elect Campbell Newman held his own press conference. He again thanked Ms Bligh for her service and says the LNP will ""vigorously"" contest the South Brisbane seat. ""I thank her for her service to Queensland... I particularly again pay tribute to her fantastic leadership during Cyclone Yasi and the floods. She did do a tremendous job and she needs to always be remembered for that,"" Mr Newman said. Mr Newman says it is now time for his party to get to work. ""What I'll be asking all the new MPs to do is to get to work, firstly thanking the people that have supported them throughout this campaign... and we will have a party room meeting on Wednesday. ""I will then be giving them some further direction about how they should go forward. ""The big thing for them is to get going in their electorates... there is a lot of work to be done."" Mr Newman reiterated his thanks to Queenslanders and vowed to keep his promises. ""We thank Queenslanders for their votes, we will not let them down, we will keep our promises, this is a win for them and it will always be about them as long as I am the premier of this state."" He outlined some key goals for the state - to achieve a 4 per cent unemployment rate; to make cost of living savings; and to cut waste and inefficiency. He also announced Jeff Seeney will be Deputy Premier and the Minister for State Development, while Tim Nicholls will take on the Treasury and Trade portfolios.

Campbell Kevin Thomas Newman (born 12 August 1963) is an Australian former politician who served as the 38th Premier of Queensland from 26 March 2012 to 14 February 2015. He served as the member for Ashgrove in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland between 24 March 2012 and 31 January 2015. He was LNP Leader from 2 April 2011 to 7 February 2015; Newman previously served as the 15th Lord Mayor of Brisbane from 27 March 2004 to 3 April 2011. Newman was elected to the lord mayorship as a member of the Liberal Party. He became a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) following the July 2008 merger of the Queensland Liberals and the Nationals. In March 2011, Newman announced that he would challenge opposition leader John-Paul Langbroek for the leadership of the LNP. Langbroek resigned, and Newman was elected his successor. As Newman was not a member of the Legislative Assembly, former state Nationals leader Jeff Seeney was elected interim opposition leader while Newman headed the party's election team from outside the legislature. Newman led the LNP in the 2012 state election, winning 78 of 89 seats from a 44-seat two-party swing, a record for Queensland. At the same time, he was elected to the seat of Ashgrove in western Brisbane. He was sworn in as premier two days later, becoming the first Brisbane-based non-Labor premier in 97 years. At the 2015 state election, the Newman-led LNP suffered a 14.0-point two-party swing, resulting in a hung parliament—of 89 seats, Labor won 44 seats and the statewide two-party vote while the LNP were reduced to 42 seats. Newman himself lost his own seat to his Labor predecessor, Kate Jones. On 10 February 2015, Newman submitted his resignation and he was replaced as premier by Annastacia Palaszczuk four days later as Labor formed a minority government. In July 2021, Newman resigned from the LNP, and in August 2021 announced he had joined the Liberal Democrats and would be standing as the party's lead Senate candidate in Queensland at the 2022 Australian federal election. Newman was the first premier of Queensland from the Liberal National Party. == Early life and military career == Campbell Newman was born on 12 August 1963 in Canberra, to parents who later both represented Tasmania in the federal parliament and were both ministers in Liberal–National coalition governments. His father, Kevin, represented the federal seat of Bass from 1975 to 1984, and was a minister in the Fraser government. His mother, Jocelyn Newman (née Mullett), was a Senator for Tasmania (1986–2002) and a minister in the Howard government. Campbell Newman was raised in Tasmania, attending Launceston Church Grammar School, then returned to Canberra. He joined the Australian Army as a staff cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1981, graduating as a lieutenant in 1985. He spent 13 years in the army, resigning in 1993 with the rank of major. He has an honours degree in civil engineering from the University of New South Wales. He moved to Queensland, where he graduated with an MBA from the University of Queensland, then worked as a consultant for PA Consulting Group, and subsequently for the agricultural storage company Grainco, before deciding to stand for election as lord mayor of Brisbane. == Lord Mayor of Brisbane == In the 2004 election, Newman narrowly defeated Labor incumbent Tim Quinn. However, a majority of wards returned Labor councillors, meaning Newman had to work with a Labor-dominated civic cabinet and a Labor deputy mayor. The most significant infrastructure item initiated or delivered during this first term was the TransApex package of bridge, traffic and tunnel projects. In the 2008 election, Newman was re-elected and the Liberals took control of the council by taking five wards from Labor. Newman was selected as one of 25 mayors from across the world shortlisted for the 2010 World Mayor Prize, an online competition aimed at raising the profile of civic leaders. When the result",1,1,5,1
25,what form of currency does china have?,yuan,Renminbi,"What is the currency in China? Currency and Payment The Chinese currency, the yuan (or, officially, the renminbi), is the currency used throughout China except in the regions of Hong Kong and Macao. Whether it's about your budget, expenses, or the cost of living, learning about Chinese currency (coins and notes, payment, withdrawals, etc.) ensures a more relaxing and less expensive stay. In this guide, you'll learn everything you need to know about currency in China so that you can set off to the Middle Kingdom with complete confidence. What is the official Chinese currency? The official currency of China is the renminbi, more often called the yuan. It is issued by the People's Bank of China: Its symbol is ""Y="" or ""Yuan ,"" Its abbreviation is RMB or CNY, 1 euro is worth around79 yuan, Each yuan can be divided into 10 jiao (cents). In everyday speak, it's common to hear the names kuai and mao used to refer to yuan and jiao, respectively. Chinese currency also used to include the fen, corresponding to 0.1 jiao or 0.01 yuan. However, while the fen was long used, it disappeared from circulation because of its low value. Note that while the yuan is the official currency of China, it is not used in Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, which have their own currencies: The Hong Kong dollar (HKD$), The Macau pataca (MOP), The Taiwanese dollar (NT$). What are the coins and banknotes in Chinese currency? The currency in China consists of various coins and banknotes, ranging from 1 jiao to 100 yuan: There is little circulation of counterfeit currency in China, but it still happens, especially with banknotes. To verify the authenticity of a Chinese currency note, look in the light to see if the watermark of the People's Bank of China is present on the front of the note, on the left side. You can also run your finger over Mao's collar -- if it is rough, the note is genuine. Send money to China with Western Union How can you pay in China? There are several ways to pay in China: cash, bank card and mobile payment. A few years ago, mobile payment via WeChat Pay or Alipay replaced cash as the most popular payment method throughout the country. Let's go over the details of these different payment methods: Cash: Although used slightly less nowadays, cash remains very common for everyday spending. However, merchants are often unable to give change and therefore no longer accept cash. If you have 100 renminbi in Chinese currency, consider going to a supermarket to get smaller denominations. Bank card (credit or debit): Rarely used by Chinese people for everyday things. However, international credit cards are still accepted in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, as well as at major hotels and in luxury boutiques, and are convenient for booking domestic flights or train journeys. Mobile payments: Now the preferred payment method for Chinese people, whether they're buying or selling, they can be used everywhere by scanning a merchant's QR code. There are two major mobile payment apps: WeChat Pay and Alipay. To create an account, simply provide a non-Chinese phone number, your passport information and bank card details. Mobile payments are the best option in China, as they are accepted everywhere and make transactions much easier. They also allow you to travel without having to carry a lot of money. However, it's still recommended to have small Chinese currency notes on you, in case you need it. And, whatever your payment method, learn to haggle in Chinese stores and markets. To negotiate well, it's important to choose the store wisely, know the approximate price of the item you want, and the maximum price you're willing to pay. Above all, always be respectful. Can you pay in euro in China? With some exceptions, you can't pay in either euro or dollars in China. The vast majority of businesses only accept yuan.

Chinese Yuan Renminbi Currency CNY The Chinese yuan renminbi (simplified Chinese: Ren Min Bi ), or CNY, which means 'people's currency', is the official currency of the People's Republic of China. The term 'renminbi' refers to the name of the currency while 'yuan' refers to the basic unit of the Chinese currency. The symbol of the renminbi is Y=. As it is shared with the Japanese yen (JPY), CNY= is sometimes used to distinguish the Chinese yuan renminbi from the yen. The renminbi, introduced in 1948, is abbreviated as RMB but it is not an official currency code. Markets located in Hong Kong that trade the Chinese currency at free-floating rates use another unofficial code - CNH. The RMB acts as one of the most-held reserve currencies in the world, while being the eighth most-traded currency globally. In 1948, the first edition of the Chinese yuan renminbi was introduced by the People's Bank of China, with the RMB issued in banknotes only. In 1955, a revaluation happened, resulting in the introduction of the new yuan renminbi at the exchange rate of 1 new yuan to 10,000 old yuan. Since the 1950s, numerous series of the Chinese currency have been issued, having their own banknotes and coins. In 1978, the dual track currency system was implemented, with the Chinese yuan renminbi being used only domestically. Therefore foreigners had to use exchange certificates, which led to a strong black market. In the 1990s, the dual track currency system was abandoned. From 1997 to 2005, the Chinese currency was pegged to the US dollar at the exchange rate of approximately 1 USD to 8.3 CNY. Since 2006, the Chinese yuan renminbi has had a floating exchange rate. Trivia The word 'yuan' means 'round'. The 'redback' is a nickname for the Chinese yuan renminbi, similarly to the slang term for the US dollar - 'greenback'. China's central bank announced in 2019 that a digital renminbi, also called DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) was going to be released soon. However, China's digital currency won't be based on cryptocurrency.

The history of Chinese currency spans more than 3000 years from ancient china to imperial china and modern China. Currency of some type has been used in China since the Neolithic age which can be traced back to between 3000 and 4500 years ago. The history of China's monetary system traces back to the Shang Dynasty (c. 1766–1154 BCE), where cowrie shells served as early currency. Cowry shells are believed to have been the earliest form of currency used in Central China, and were used during the Neolithic period. By the Warring States Period, diverse metal currencies like knife and spade coins emerged. These early currencies, starting as a commodity exchange to cowrie shells, copper coins, paper money and modern chinese currencies and digital currencies shows how centralized power developed the most influential monetary system in the world. Early Establishment The Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BC) came as a significant first step in the evolution of currency by introducing cowrie shells as a mode of exchange. Cowries, sourced from the Indian Ocean, were valued for their rarity, durability, and portability. Their usage as currency likely came from their symbolic value which represented wealth and status. Archaeological findings, such as cowrie shell imitations made of bone and stone, indicate the growing institutionalization of monetary practices during this period. One of the reasons why they started producing cowrie shell imitations was mainly due to the lack of organic cowrie shells. New Research on the Origin of Cowries in Ancient China by K.Peng also mentions tributes and exchanges involving cowries, highlighting their role in economic context. Zhou Dynasty ((Western Zhou c. 1046 – 771 BC) and (Eastern Zhou c. 771 – 256 BC)) saw the diversification of currency forms. By the late Western Zhou and early Eastern Zhou, bronze objects such as spades and knife-shaped coins began circulating alongside cowries. These currencies reflected both regional economic diversity and the growing influence of metalworking technologies. The Warring States Period (c. 475 – 221 BC) expanded on the diversity of currencies as competing states issued their own coinages to assert economic independence. Bronze inscriptions on Zhou coins serve as primary evidence which gives details about issuing authorities and intended denominations. These inscriptions show the relationship between political authority and economic systems. Qin Dynasty (c. 221 – 206 BC) specifically Around 210 BC, the first emperor of China Qin Shi Huang (260–210 BC) abolished all other forms of local currency and introduced a uniform ""Ban Liang"" copper coin which eliminated the regional variations that had characterized the Warring States Period and showed economic integration and simplifying taxation. Qin legal texts found in tombs (e.g., Shuijingzhu bamboo slips) document the implementation of the Ban Liang coins and highlight their role in centralizing economic control. This standardization served as a model for future dynasties that influenced monetary policies in subsequent centuries. Building on Qin’s monetary reforms, Han Dynasty (c. 202 BCE – 220 CE) later introduced ""Wu Zhu"" coins, which remained in circulation for over 700 years. The Han government’s emphasis on coinage stability facilitated trade along the Silk Road, integrating China into a broader network of Eurasian commerce. These coins, marked by their consistent weight and size, reflected the dynasty’s commitment to economic stability. The Han period also saw the integration of commodity trade and currency usage. Goods like silk, salt, and iron often supplemented or substituted coinage in transactions, particularly in regions where coin circulation was limited. Paper money was invented in China in the 7th century, but the base unit of currency remained the copper coin. Copper coins were used as the chief denomination of currency in China until the introduction of the yuan. From paper money innovations in the Song",1,3,5,5

Granville attended school in Columbus, Ohio until age 10, but had to leave due to his family's poverty, which meant he needed to work; he served an apprenticeship in a machine shop and learned the trades of machinist and blacksmith. Some sources of his day asserted that he also received two years of college-level training in ""electrical and mechanical engineering,"" but little is known about where he might have studied. Career In 1872, Woods obtained a job as a fireman on the Danville and Southern Railroad in Missouri. He eventually became an engineer, and in December 1874 moved to Springfield, Illinois, and worked at a rolling mill, the Springfield Iron Works. He studied mechanical and electrical engineering in college from 1876-1878. In 1878, he took a job aboard the steamer ""Ironsides"", and, within two years, became Chief Engineer. When he returned to Ohio, he became an engineer with the Dayton and Southwestern Railroad in southwestern Ohio. In 1880, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and established his business as an electrical engineer and an inventor. After receiving the multiplex telegraph patent, he reorganized his Cincinnati company as the Woods Electric Co. In 1892 he moved his research operations to New York City, where he was joined by his brother, Lyates Woods, who also had several inventions. Although the newspapers of his day generally referred to him as a bachelor, Woods was married to Ada Woods who was granted a divorce from him in 1891. Granville T. Woods was often described as an articulate and well-spoken man, as meticulous and stylish in his choice of clothing, and as a man who preferred to dress in black. At times, he would refer to himself as an immigrant from Australia, in the belief that he would be given more respect if people thought he was from a foreign country, as opposed to being an African American. In his day, the black newspapers frequently expressed their pride in his achievements, saying he was ""the greatest of Negro inventors"", and sometimes even calling him ""professor"", although there is no evidence he ever received a college degree. Inventions Granville T. Woods invented and patented Tunnel Construction for the electric railroad system, and was referred to by some as the ""Black Edison"". Over the course of his lifetime Granville Woods obtained more than 50 patents for inventions including an automatic brake, an egg incubator, and for improvements to other technologies such as the safety circuit, telegraph, telephone, and phonograph. In 1884, Woods received his first patent for a steam boiler furnace, and in 1885, Woods patented an apparatus which was a combination of a telephone and a telegraph. The device, which he called ""telegraphony"", would allow a telegraph station to send voice and telegraph messages through Morse code over a single wire. He sold the rights to this device to the American Bell Telephone Company. In 1887, he patented the Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph which allowed communications between train stations from moving trains by creating a magnetic field around a coiled wire under the train. Woods caught smallpox prior to patenting the technology and Lucius Phelps patented it in 1884. In 1887, Woods used notes, sketches and a working model of the invention to secure the patent. The invention was so successful that Woods began the Woods Electric Company in Cincinnati, Ohio to market and sell his patents. However, the company quickly became devoted to invention creation until it dissolved in 1893. Thomas Edison later filed a claim to the ownership of this patent, stating that he had first created a similar telegraph and that he was entitled to the patent for the device, and Woods often had difficulties in enjoying his success as other inventors made claims to his devices. Woods was twice successful in defending himself, proving that there were no other devices upon which he could have depended or relied upon to make his device. After Thomas Edison's second defeat, he decided to offer Granville Woods a position with the Edison Company, but Granville declined. In 1888, Woods manufactured a system of overhead electric conducting lines for railroads modeled after the system pioneered by Charles van Depoele, a famed inventor who had by then installed his electric railway system in thirteen U.S. cities. Following the Great Blizzard of 1888, New York City Mayor Hugh J. Grant declared that all wires, many of which powered the above ground rail system, had to be removed and buried, emphasizing the need for an underground system. Woods' patent built upon previous third rail systems which were used for light rails and increased the power for use on underground trains. His system relied on wire brushes to make connections with metallic terminal heads without exposing wires by installing electrical contactor rails. Once the train car had passed over, the wires were no longer live reducing the risk of injury. It was successfully tested in February 1892 in Coney Island on the Figure Eight Roller Coaster. Later that year, he was arrested and charged with libel after taking out an advertisement in a trade magazine warning against patronizing the American Engineering Company of New York City. The company had provided funds for Woods to market the invention but a crucial component of the invention was missing from the deal which the manager of the company, James S. Zerbe, later stole. A jury acquitted Woods, but Zerbe had already patented the design in Europe and the design was valued at $1 million. Woods patented the invention in 1893 and in 1901, he sold it to General Electric. In 1896, Woods created a system for controlling electrical lights in theaters, known as the ""safety dimmer,"" which was economical, safe, and efficient, saving 40% of electricity use. Woods is also sometimes credited with the invention of the air brake for trains in 1904; however, George Westinghouse patented the air brake almost 40 years prior, making Woods' contribution an improvement to the invention. Death and legacy Granville T. Woods gravesite marker in St. Michael's Cemetery Woods died of a cerebral hemorrhage at Harlem Hospital in New York City on January 30, 1910, having sold a number of his devices to such companies as Westinghouse, General Electric and American Engineering. Until 1975, his resting place was an unmarked grave, but historian M.A. Harris helped to raise funds, and persuaded several of the corporations that used Woods' inventions to donate funds to purchase a headstone. It was erected at St. Michael's Cemetery in Elmhurst, Queens. Baltimore City Community College established the Granville T. Woods scholarship in memory of the inventor. In 2004, the New York City Transit Authority organized an exhibition on Woods which utilized bus and train depots, and an issue of four million MetroCards commemorating the inventor's achievements in pioneering the third rail.

Granville T. Woods, Electrical Engineer Black engineer Granville T Woods spent a crucial decade in Cincinnati beginning in the early 1880's, devising and patenting inventions mostly at the intersection of electricity and railroads. To dispense quickly with the Walnut Hills connection, Woods never lived in our neighborhood; for a while, he made his home on Fulton Avenue near the foot of Kemper Lane and that address is sometime confused with the Fulton near Eden Park. Nor did he work directly on the first experimental electric streetcar line in Walnut Hills. Woods discussed using a system he had patented with the entrepreneur who built the line, George Kerper. Moreover, Woods held a patent on the electrical connection between the car and the overhead power lines that was used on that line. But wealthy Cincinnati partners in the Woods Electric Company held out for more money for Woods' patents, and Kerper used a competing electrical system. We will see in this series of posts that Woods' work in Cincinnati, with a unique combination of technical and legal challenges, shaped with way he approached the engineering problems surrounding his patents on various electrical transmission and control systems used on street railroads. He also invented a wireless communication system that allowed moving trains to communicate with stations and with each other, and several more safety devices for railroads and electric circuits. But Woods did one at least one occasion give a lecture about electricity and magnetism in Walnut Hills. At any rate, he was important enough in the electric streetcar industry, and streetcar lines were important enough to the development of Walnut Hills, that it's worth a look at his biography and his inventions. Granville T. Woods in Ohio: Connections to the Black Community Granville T. Woods, who lived in Cincinnati in the 1880's, has been practically defined as an engineer. Yet he also lived as Black man in the nineteenth century - born free before the Civil War, he came of age in the era of reconstruction and his career matured under increasing Jim Crow oppression. Fortunately, a Black Brooklyn bus driver and historian named David Head has brought more attention to Woods as a man struggling to make his way in Reconstruction and Jim Crow America. Head's common-sense work with standard sources like the census has unearthed the straightforward biography that Woods himself was at pains to conceal later in life. Granville's father Cyrus, a wood sawyer born in Tennessee in about 1810, owned some property in and around the central Ohio town of Monroe. His mother, from Virginia, was widowed with three children before she married Cyrus. She worked as a washerwoman. It is not clear how either one of the parents came to live in the free state of Ohio. In June 1850, the census showed the family had grown to include five children -- but did not yet enumerate Granville. The Woodses lived in a cluster of three Black families; the Census book noted only a few other single individuals in the neighborhood notated with the color ""B."" Census records from 1860 (still in the town of Monroe) and 1870 (in Columbus) indicate that Granville was born in 1850 or 1851. His father Cyrus, perhaps a sometime preacher, lived to see emancipation, although he died in 1866. Granville and his parents, and perhaps his younger brother William, appear sporadically in Columbus city directories through the 1850's, '60's and early '70's - the sort of sketchy paper trail left by most working people. (The trail is a little trampled by overuse; another, white, Granville Woods was born a few years later and lived in the same area, and a second Black Granville Woods from Virginia, about ten years older, lived in Salem in northeastern Ohio. Moreover, the 1870 Census lookups sometimes misspell ""Woods"" as ""Woode."") The community in Columbus in 1870 portrayed by the census was substantially integrated - enough so that the enumerator took the trouble to fill in all the race boxes with ""B"", ""W"", or ""M"" for mulatto - people of visibly mixed race. It is also striking that many of Granville's neighbors of color held middle class jobs, some requiring mechanical skills (""Runs Stationary [steam] Engine"", ""Works in Machine Shop,"" ""Works in Sawmill,"" ""Journeyman Blacksmith,"" ""Journeyman Plumber,"" ""Journeyman Bricklayer,"" ""Journeyman Paperhanger,"" ""Works at Tannery"") and others quite respectable and relatively lucrative (Grocer, Barber) . Most women in male-headed households had their occupations listed as ""at home,"" indicating that they did not work outside of it or take in work - then as for another century a sign of middle-class security. To be sure there were also a couple of Teamsters and a couple of Laborers; women who headed their households (including Granville's widowed mother in 1870) generally worked as ""Washerwoman."" On the whole, though, rather like Walnut Hills in Cincinnati, the Woods' neighborhood in Columbus included relatively prosperous African Americans. David Jenkins Granville and his mother in 1870 lived near enough to David Jenkins to appear in adjacent dwellings on the census form. Perhaps the leading Black citizen in the small Columbus community, Jenkins for a short time in the 1840's edited the Palladium of Liberty, an abolitionist newspaper. Jenkins was also an important figure in the state-wide Black Conventions of the mid nineteenth century; he would have been well-known in Cincinnati. Active in the community's church and masonic institutions, Jenkins welcomed Granville as a young man into a Black masonic lodge in Columbus. Granville Woods himself appeared in the census as a ""Church Sexton"" -maintenance worker - a position confirmed in the Columbus City Directory of 1873. In his twenties, he also worked in a couple of carriage shops, a stint as a porter, and as a waiter. It's impossible to know which of these jobs in the directory may have been full time, and whether they precluded other employment. The job as Sexton in the Church must have been long-term and part time, since it appears in both the 1870 census and the 1873 directory; other listings in the directory before and after included the other occupations. It is plausible that Granville spent time in some of these positions (including as a Church Sexton) among machinists, as his later biography in Simmons's Men of Mark would indicate. He may also have found work with some of the Black men in the neighborhood holding mechanical jobs. The employment trail in Columbus runs cold in the later 1870's. We will pick up with solid documentation in Cincinnati beginning in 1882. Granville T. Woods in the fabric of the Black Community in Cincinnati When Granville T. Woods migrated to Cincinnati, he entered a larger and more established Black community than the one he had left in Columbus nearly a decade earlier. We have met many of the leading African Americans in Cincinnati in previous posts. Granville found his way into the fabric of that society. His acceptance and status were probably aided by his acquaintance with his Columbus neighbor David Jenkins. As an underground railroad operative, Jenkins would certainly have known the Black Cincinnati furniture manufacturer Henry Boyd. Likewise, Jenkins' participation in the Black Conventions in Ohio would have put him in contact with John Gaines and Peter Clarke. Finally, Jenkins' induction of Granville Woods into African Freemasonry would have given the younger man an immediate way into his new city's educational elite. Peter Clark, the unrelated Samuel Clark and William H. Parham were all leading freemasons and teachers in the segregated Colored Schools. Woods was embraced by the semi-secret society. Understanding Woods' personal life in Ohio is more problematic. In June 1880 he married a Sadie Turner; the marriage license report in the Cincinnati Star marked is his first appearance in Cincinnati. (Other news included the Democrats uniting for General Hancock in the convention national Convention meeting in Cincinnati; the Ohio Republican James Garfield would win the election in the fall.) The city directory the next year listed Sadie Woods, laundress, working at the southeast corner of Canal and Race as well as an ""S. Woods, engineer"" living at the same address. It's not clear whether those entries indicate the recently married couple or not. In 1882 Granville Woods makes his first unequivocal appearance in the directory, living on Fulton Street in the Fulton neighborhood on the near east side; there is no entry for Sadie although it was uncommon for wives to leave any evidence in the directories. We can follow Woods around various downtown neighborhoods in the annual Williams Directories between 1882 and 1891. His footprints in the community are a little light, but he made his way into the odd gossip column. There is no indication that he entered into any business relationships with Black Cincinnatians, but very few in the community had the sort of capital required to engage in serious manufacturing. In 1891, he was sued for divorce by an Ada Woods in the same city; some recent accounts assume that Ada and Sadie were the same woman. Another 1891 story in Cincinnati's Enquirer - a democratic newspaper unsympathetic to Blacks, free or freed - suggest a more complicated domestic life. At any rate, accounts of Woods' serious bout of smallpox while in Cincinnati - appearing in all places in patent litigation - refer to male acquaintances nursing him but make no mention of a wife. Apart from inventing, there is passing mention of Granville Woods in Cincinnati in a few articles during the 1880's. In good nineteenth-century fashion he gave lectures on electricity and magnetism in public forums in the city. One venue was the rather new YMCA (before there was a segregated Black Y), a common place for educational events. Yet Woods also lectured about his area of expertise in his own community. On one occasion he spoke in a Black Baptist Church downtown. In Walnut Hills, he gave a lecture/demonstration at Brown Chapel AME - already in the 1880's a well-established congregation. Brown Chapel was at the time a short block away the street from the Elm Street Colored School (later Frederick Douglass) in Walnut Hills. In 1887 a Black Baptist minister, teacher and college president in Lexington, Kentucky named William J. Simmons published Men of Mark, a collection of biographies of 172 leading African American men. It seems that Simmons lightly edited submissions by his subjects; one such man took this work as an opportunity to introduce himself as ""Granville T. Woods, Esq, Electrician - Mechanical - Engineer - Manufacturer of Telephone, Telegraph and Electrical Instruments."" Woods presented a neat chronology: born in Columbus, Ohio, 1856; went to work in a machine shop there 1866; 1872, moved to Missouri to work on a railroad and study electricity in his leisure time; 1874 moved to Illinois to work in a rolling-mill; 1876, moved ""East"" to study electrical and mechanical engineering ""at college"" in the afternoons and evening after a day shift in a machine shop; 1878 to sea aboard a British steam ship; 1880, as an engineer on a Dayton, Ohio railroad and then on to a manufacturing career in Cincinnati. As we have seen, Ohio Census records show consistently that Woods was born about 5 years earlier than this biography suggests; his later accounts of his own life would make him younger still. It's not clear whether the claim that he started working in a machine shop in 1866 might be true, starting at the age of about fifteen rather than the age of ten computed from the biography. The dates for other moves are also plausible: he appeared in Columbus directories consistently through 1874, and then once more in 1877. He married in Cincinnati in 1880, certainly compatible with employment on a Dayton-based railroad. On the other hand, the claims of engineering studies at college may be exaggerated; the title of engineer might likewise have dignified a position as a ""fireman."" Woods in fact proved adept at self-promotion. In this biography for Simmons' book, he quoted a whole raft of newspaper articles touting his genius. He wrote the Cincinnati Sun reported that ""Granville T. Woods, a young colored man of this city, has invented a new system of electrical motor, for street railroads. He has invented also a number of other electrical appliances, and the syndicate controlling his inventions think they have found Edison's successor."" We shall return to this Cincinnati syndicate in a later post. The comparison between Woods and Edison continues to the present day. The biography produced more quotes: in January 1886, The Catholic Tribune had opined ""Granville T. Woods, the greatest colored inventor in the history of the race, and equal, if not superior, to any inventor in the country, is destined to revolutionize the mode of streetcar transit."" The related publication The American Catholic Tribune, possibly the same correspondent, in January 1887 had said ""Mr. Woods, who is the greatest electrician in the world, still continues to add to his long list of inventions"" including the Induction Telegraph. ""Mr. Woods has all the patent office drawings for those devices, as your correspondent witnessed."" In his management of the newspaper coverage Woods was absolutely in line with successful white electrical inventors. His composition of his own biography citing these flattering passages is likewise of a piece with the self-promotion practiced by the likes of Edison and Westinghouse and Tesla. What is not clear from their titles is that the Catholic newspapers were both edited by Black Cincinnatians. Woods parlayed the stories he had provided to these friendly correspondents into evidence in a biographical sketch that is mined to this day for the quotes he provided. That is to say, Woods found in Reconstruction Cincinnati a Black community in which he had natural allies. It seemed for a short, thrilling time that he would make his way in our city as a great inventor, a rival or successor to the industrial engineers creating huge technical and corporate systems to distribute electric lights and telephones and telegraphs and railroads in a rapidly industrializing world. Like successful white inventors, he learned how to patent his ideas; unlike most rivals he also learned how to defend his intellectual property in the arcane and fast-changing system of patent law, patent interference, and patent infringement. Woods went on in a similar vein through the whole of his Simmons biography. He quoted extensively from an 1885 article in the important magazine Scientific American that described frequent collisions on railroads and hopes for their prevention by a newly patented invention - the induction telegraph - which allowed moving trains to communicate with nearby stations, and with other moving trains. The correspondent of the Catholic Tribune had seen with his own eyes Woods' drawings, accepted by the patent office. What Woods did not mention here was that the Scientific American article described a patent applied for by a white inventor. Woods had also applied for a patent on the device. The patent office ruled between the time of the Scientific American article and Simmons' biography that Woods' invention had priority, so he was claiming credit where credit was due. The passage Woods quoted from the American Catholic Tribune closed with the observation the ""patent office has twice declared Mr. Woods prior inventor of the induction telegraph as against Mr. Edison, who claims to be the prior inventor. The Edison & Phelps Company are now negotiating a consolidation with Woods' Railway Telegraph Company."" Yet the patent priority had not earned him any mention in the Scientific American, and the patent alone did not produce either devices or income; the drawn-out legal dispute ended with Woods selling the patent to the Edison interests for a relatively small sum. Yet the partial victory did provide tremendous prestige and bragging rights. Granville T. Woods: What did success look like? Granville T. Woods in some sense failed as an electrical inventor in Cincinnati: while he patented several brilliant inventions none of them produced much income. His wealthy white partners rarely paid him a salary and refused to manufacture any of his devices; it was in hopes of steady income backing for a factory that Woods signed up with them. We might wonder why the investors made so little effort. To be sure Woods lived and worked in the city during the 1880s - the era of the ""redemption"" of Confederate ideas in the South and of ever hardening Jim Crow in the North. But I don't think that established inheritors of wealth in the Queen City would have gone to the trouble to establish the Woods Electric Company simply in order to spite a Black man. I would suggest his inability to establish himself and the corporation as major players in the nation's emerging heavy electrical industries was as much a failure vision in Cincinnati's business community as of anything Woods did or did not do. The city's moneyed elite wanted sure bets to manage and market rather than venture capital opportunities. Woods engineered competitive products on the cutting edge of emerging technologies. He also, against all odds, managed to protect his patents, especially the Induction Telegraph that allowed communications between moving trains, stations, and other trains. As Edison would do with the lightbulb, Woods also patented parts required to implement his basic invention - relays that allowed the conversion of the weak inductive coupling into a signal strong enough to actuate a telegraph sounder. It was not Woods, but the Gano-controlled board of his manufacturing concern, who failed to capitalize this essential device. George Kerper, another Cincinnati outsider, was gambling on new transportation technologies. He had built the Mt. Adam Incline and Cincinnati's first cable car up Gilbert Avenue. The cable car had involved new patents and designs by a young Cincinnatian who was the college-educated son of the owner of the largest machine shop west of the Alleghenies. In 1887 Kerper was working with Granville Woods to build an electric streetcar in Cincinnati. Again, Gano's board was willing to try to sell a license Woods' patents but unwilling to construct or underwrite an experimental electric streetcar line on May Street in Walnut Hills. The contract went instead to an inventor from upstate New York name Daft. Frank Sprague, sometime Edison power generation engineer, opened the first electric streetcar system in Richmond, Virginia in 1888. Sprague sold more than a hundred of his streetcar installations within a couple of years; Edison bought the business and manufactured the electrical components. In this case, Cincinnati's financial powers missed what became the most lucrative municipal transportation technology for the next half-century. Woods, perhaps convinced that the Cincinnati business community didn't have the vision to invest in the new technologies he had mastered, left for New York. In 1890 a test track based on a new design by Woods was constructed in Coney Island, the neighborhood in Brooklyn New York that would host so many amusement parks. The system had two radical innovations. First, the power cables were carried underneath the tracks in the same sort of covered trench used for cable cars. That feature was safer and lower maintenance than conventional overhead wires and made conversion of cable cars to electric streetcars inexpensive and simple. Second, by using a sophisticated system of electro-magnetic switches (solenoids) Woods was able to insure only the contacts in the section of track under the car were electrically activated; as the car moved on the system switched the power off. This improved safety since a shovel or a cane that found its accidental way into the power slots would not carry a dangerous current to its holder. It also reduced energy losses owing to stray currents and leakage. The design was adopted, with little financial remuneration to Woods, in the Manhattan subways and elevated railways. Woods gained the respect of the major electrical inventors and manufacturers. In New York between 1892 and his death in 1910, at the age of 59, he sold more than 20 patents in emerging technologies. These included eight electric railway patents to General Electric, three patents for electric brake controllers on trains to Westinghouse, four patents on electric motor controllers to Harry Ward Leonard - Thomas Edison's chief of power distribution systems before he set out on his own. As he had done when he settled in Cincinnati Woods invented a new biography in New York. Beginning in 1892 he adopted a third birthdate - 1863 - and now a second birthplace: Australia! He claimed that one grandmother was a Malay Indian and his other grandparents Australian Aborigines. It is possible, as some now suggest, that he determined to make his visible Blackness more exotic in order to escape the degrading heritage of enslaved ancestors. Yet most early accounts that commented on his ostensibly Black Australian ancestry observed that the Aborigines were even lower in the Great Chain of Being than Black Africans. Perhaps Woods, comfortable with his own genius, was playing with the Social Darwinists, defiantly proclaiming that even those labelled the lowest of humankind could thrive in its most esoteric scientific technology.

The following is a list of fictional characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios's 2014 feature film adaptation of Big Hero 6, as well as its follow-up television shows Big Hero 6: The Series and Baymax! and its subsequent comic book adaptation through IDW Publishing, based on characters created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau (credited to Man of Action) and published by Marvel Comics. While the titular characters originated from Marvel Comics, their characterizations and supporting cast were newly invented by Disney, making their appearance a radical departure from the source material. == Film introductions == === Hiro Hamada === Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) is a 14-year-old technology prodigy who initially planned to use his mental brilliance to con others through back alley bot fighting. Through the advice and swaying of his older brother Tadashi, Hiro decided to join the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology and put his brain to work. However, tragedy struck when Tadashi perished in a fire. From this, Hiro decided to use his smarts to form a team with his friends and lead Big Hero 6. Hiro is loosely based on Hiro Takachiho. === Baymax === Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) is an inflatable healthcare robot that was created by Tadashi Hamada. Baymax's only function has been to help people not just physically, but mentally and emotionally as well. After Tadashi's death, Baymax felt that his purpose was now to help Tadashi's younger brother Hiro. Equipped with ""10,000 different medical procedures"", and various forms of martial arts, but a loose grasp of common thinking, Baymax does all he can to rescue people in more ways than one. Baymax is loosely based on the character of the same name. === Honey Lemon === Honey Lemon (voiced by Genesis Rodriguez) is a chemist who enjoys what she does. While somewhat maniacal and eccentric, she deeply cares for her friends and does everything she can to bring optimism to the group. She does not necessarily think violence is the answer to everything, but she will throw herself into the fight when needed. Honey Lemon is loosely based on Aiko Miyazaki. === Go Go Tomago === Ethel ""Go Go"" Tomago (voiced by Jamie Chung) is a sarcastic adrenaline junkie who prefers working with electromagnets. She is a team player. When fighting, she comes off as the most experienced due to her background but prefers to fight alongside her team. Go Go is loosely based on Leiko Tanaka. === Wasabi === Wasabi (voiced by Damon Wayans Jr. in the film and Khary Payton in other forms of media) is an expert in laser technology but is an OCD neat freak who prefers to have systems and order in favor of chaos and spontaneity. While he is cowardly, he pulls through for his friends and occasionally shows a flare for the heroic life much to everyone's and his shock. Wasabi is loosely based on Wasabi-No-Ginger. === Fred === Frederick Flamarian ""Fred"" Frederickson IV (voiced by T.J. Miller in the film and Kingdom Hearts III and Brooks Wheelan in the series) is a total comic book nerd who, despite being the son of a billionaire, spends his time as a sign-flipping school mascot who is a ""science enthusiast"". Armed with a kaiju costume dubbed ""Fredzilla"" and his knowledge of comic book lore, his antics amuse, annoy and aid his friends on the team. Fred is loosely based on the character of the same name. === Tadashi Hamada === Tadashi Hamada (voiced by Daniel Henney) was the older brother to Hiro and, just like him, displayed a knack for understanding and building various forms of technology. He built Baymax for the sole purpose of helping people but was unable to see this to fruition due to his early death. His death sets in motion a series of events that would lead Hiro to form the Big Hero 6. === Aunt Cass === Aunt Cass is Hiro and Tadashi's aunt and guardian, who was granted custody of them after the death of her sister and brother-in-law, and owner of the Lucky Cat Café.

27,who does jeremy lin play for?,Jeremy Lin most recently played for the Beijing Ducks in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).,Houston Rockets,"Jeremy Shu-How Lin (born August 23, 1988) is a Taiwanese-American professional basketball player for the New Taipei Kings of the Taiwan Professional Basketball League (TPBL). He unexpectedly led a winning turnaround with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) during the 2011–12 season, sparking a cultural phenomenon known as ""Linsanity"". Lin was the first American of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, and is one of the few Asian Americans to have played in the league. He is the first Asian American player to win an NBA championship, having done so with the Toronto Raptors in 2019. Lin grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and earned Northern California Basketball Player of the Year honors as a senior in high school. After receiving no athletic scholarship offers, he attended Harvard University, where he was a three-time all-conference player in the Ivy League. Undrafted out of college, Lin signed with his hometown Golden State Warriors in 2010. He seldom played in his rookie season and received assignments to the NBA Development League (D-League). In 2011, Lin was waived by both the Warriors and the Houston Rockets before joining the New York Knicks early in 2011–12. At first, Lin played sparingly for the Knicks, and he again spent time in the D-League. In February 2012, however, he was promoted to the starting lineup and led the team on a seven-game winning streak. Lin's stellar play during the season helped the Knicks make the 2012 playoffs; it also catapulted him to international fame. Lin appeared on the covers of Sports Illustrated and Time and was named to the Time 100 as one of the most influential people in the world. In July 2012, Lin won the ESPY Award for Breakthrough Athlete of the Year. Following his Knicks tenure, Lin played for the Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers, Charlotte Hornets, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks, and Toronto Raptors. While he experienced some success in Houston and Charlotte, he battled injuries in the ensuing seasons. In August 2019, he left the NBA and signed with the Beijing Ducks, where he became an All-Star in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). Attempting to return to the NBA, Lin played with the Warriors' development team in 2021. He returned to the CBA and played with the Ducks and later the Guangzhou Loong Lions. He left the Loong Lions midseason in 2022–23 and joined PLG's Steelers in 2023. == Early life == Lin was born to a Taiwanese American family in Torrance, California, on August 23, 1988. He was raised a Christian in the Bay Area city of Palo Alto, California. His parents, Gie-ming Lin and Shirley Lin (née Xinxin Wu), emigrated from Taiwan to the United States in the mid-1970s, first settling in Virginia before moving to Indiana, where they both attended universities to study engineering and computer science. They are dual nationals of Taiwan and the U.S. Lin's paternal family are Hoklo people from Beidou, Changhua, Taiwan, while his maternal grandmother emigrated to Taiwan in the late 1940s from Pinghu, Zhejiang in mainland China. Lin's parents are both 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall. His maternal grandmother's family was tall, and her father was over 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m). Lin has an older brother, Josh, and a younger brother, Joseph. Gie-Ming taught his sons to play basketball at the local YMCA.

Top Stories Michael Jordan's decision to sell Hornets leaves some team decisions in flux With the NBA's Board of Governors unlikely to approve the sale until at least another month, how should Charlotte approach the upcoming Draft and free agency period? Steve Reed | The Associated Press June 17, 2023 4:28 PM Michael Jordan plans to keep a minority stake in the Hornets, the team he bought in 2010 for about $275 million. CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The timing of Michael Jordan's decision to sell his majority ownership stake in the Charlotte Hornets has left the organization in flux, with several looming key personnel decisions. The Hornets have the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft on Thursday night. They also have some difficult decisions to make in free agency in early July, including whether to re-sign embattled restricted free-agent Miles Bridges. With the NBA's Board of Governors unlikely to approve the team's sale to an ownership group led by Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall until at least another month or two, the question becomes who'll sign off on general manager Mitch Kupchak's potentially franchise-altering decisions this summer? Will it be Jordan, a lame duck majority owner? Or will the new ownership have a major input? Jordan will remain on as a minority owner after the sale is approved, so he still has a vested interest in the organization. Bobby Marks, a front office insider for ESPN, said the timing of the announcement makes this a unique situation. ""Whether it's Mitch or Michael making the decisions, I think you have to keep these guys from the new ownership group in the loop,"" Marks said. ""... At the end of the day, they don't technically have a say in anything yet, but I would think they have to be part of the conversation, particularly when it comes to taking on future money."" But Marks said the trade rumors swirling around the New Orleans Pelicans potentially being open to moving former No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson in order to secure the second or third pick in the draft complicates things for the Hornets. Essentially, would a trade that has long-lasting implications sit well with new ownership? ""If they have a chance to move out of the two spot, what happens when you have salary involved that stretches past this year, which means money out of their pockets? I would think you would want to get (the new ownership group's) blessing before taking on money like that,"" Marks said. ESPN commentator Jeff Van Gundy agrees. ""I would suspect there would be conversations about who they want to draft and sign before anything is finalized,"" Van Gundy said. Both Marks and Van Gundy believe the toughest decision ahead involves whether or not to re-sign Bridges. A former first-round pick out of Michigan State, Bridges had a breakout season in 2021-22. He led the team in scoring and rebounding and appeared on the verge of a huge pay day last summer before felony domestic violence charges put his career on hold. The 25-year-old Bridges wound up pleading no contest to the charges and agreed to three years probation. He missed all of last season. The NBA ultimately determined Bridges will serve a 10-game suspension once he returns to the league. The league officially suspended him for 30 games, but determined 20 games of the suspension have already been served because Bridges already missed all 82 games in 2022-23. ""In terms of the new owners you have to wonder, is that what you want your first signing to be?"" Marks said. Added Van Gundy: ""There is more to that (decision) than just basketball."" Van Gundy believes the Hornets are in good hands in terms of personnel decisions with longtime NBA general manager Mitch Kupchak at the helm. He believes both Jordan and the new owners will rely heavily upon his opinion moving forward during this time of transition. As a player, Jordan was a six-time NBA Finals MVP, a 14-time All-Star and a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He's in the conversation as the greatest basketball player of all-time. But he never approached that level of success as an owner. The Hornets were 423-600 in his 13 years as majority owner and never won a playoff series. Charlotte has failed to reach the playoffs seven straight seasons, the longest drought in the NBA. Still, Van Gundy said he was surprised when reports first surfaced that Jordan was looking to sell the team. ""He always looked to be a hands-on owner,"" Van Gundy said. ""I know he has the fishing and the auto racing that he's involved in, but I still didn't expect him to get out of the NBA. And yet he looks like he is going to make a tidy profit, so good for him."" Jordan purchased the team for $275 million in 2010 and will sell it for a reported $3 billion. ""You win with Michael Jordan the player,"" Van Gundy added. ""Those type of players will make you elite for a long time. You see it with (Nikola) Jokic. It's hard to get those players, and when you do you are set up for a long period of time. ... But the Hornets, they missed on a few high draft picks."" After finishing 7-59 in the 2011-12 season, the Hornets failed to land the No. 1 pick in the lottery and missed out on star center Anthony Davis. Charlotte settled for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist at No. 2, passing on Bradley Beal and Damion Lillard. The Hornets also selected Cody Zeller fourth overall in 2013 instead over Giannis Antetokounmpo and Steven Adams, and swung and missed on top 10 picks Frank Kaminsky and Noah Vonleh in 2014 and 2015. ""It's about the roster, the roster, the roster,"" Van Gundy said. ""The most important person in every organization is the person who picks the players.""",1,1,5,5
28,what is arkansas state capitol?,Little Rock,Little Rock,"The Louisiana State Capitol (French: Capitole de l'État de Louisiane) is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Louisiana and is located in downtown Baton Rouge. The capitol houses the chambers for the Louisiana State Legislature, made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the office of the Governor of Louisiana. At 450 feet (137 m) tall and with 34 stories, it is the tallest skyscraper in Baton Rouge, the seventh tallest building in Louisiana, and tallest capitol in the United States. It is located on a 27-acre (110,000 m2) tract, which includes the capitol gardens. The Louisiana State Capitol is often thought of as ""Huey Long's monument"" due to the influence of the former Governor and U.S. Senator in getting the capitol built. The building's construction was completed in 1931. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982. == History == In order to secure the mouth of the Mississippi River for the French, the town of New Orleans was founded in 1718 and became the capital for colony of Louisiana in 1722. In 1763, the Treaty of Paris ceded the portion of Louisiana that was west of the Mississippi River, as well as New Orleans, to Spain and the remaining territory east of the Mississippi was turned over to Great Britain. The French reclaimed Louisiana from the Spanish in 1803 after the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800; the territory was then sold as the Louisiana Purchase to the United States. The ceremonial transfers of Louisiana from Spain to France in November 1803 took place in front of the colonial seat of government, the Cabildo. The transfer from France to the U.S. occurred there as well less than a month later. New Orleans continued to be the location of the capital of the Territory of Orleans, and through its admission into the U.S. as the state of Louisiana. The State Legislature passed a resolution declaring that the seat of government be moved to a ""more convenient place"" than New Orleans. No action was taken until 1829 when the Legislature voted to move to Donaldsonville. It convened for the first time in Donaldsonville in January 1830. On January 8, 1831, it became ""dissatisfied with the quarters there"", and adjourned shortly thereafter to return to New Orleans. === Old State Capitol === Included in the Louisiana State Constitution of 1845 was a clause that required the state capital to be moved from New Orleans by 1849. A committee was formed to prepare a site for the eventual move and, the designs by James H. Dakin were chosen in a competition on May 5, 1847. The city of Baton Rouge donated a plot of land situated on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River to the state on September 7 for the construction of the new capitol. Dakin's design for the capitol consisted of a ""castellated"" Gothic Revival building, a rarity for government buildings in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on December 1, 1849 in what was planned to be a grand ceremony. However, a devastating fire in Baton Rouge a week prior saw the funds reallocated as aid for the victims, which was deemed a ""more worthy cause"". The Old State Capitol is considered the best example of Gothic Revival architecture in the South, although it was notably criticized by Mark Twain, who called it an ""architectural falsehood"" due to its cod-medieval appearance (which he attributed to the influence of Sir Walter Scott). With the start of the Civil War in 1861, and the occupation of both New Orleans and Baton Rouge by the Union Army, the location of the state government was moved to Opelousas in 1862, and then to Shreveport in 1864. The portion of Louisiana that was occupied by Union troops was governed out of New Orleans. The vacant Old State Capitol was originally used as a prison by the Union Army and, then, as a garrison for its colored troops. On December 28, 1862, it was gutted by an accidental fire. After the war, the state government retu

The Minnesota State Capitol is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Minnesota, in its capital city of Saint Paul. It houses the Minnesota Senate, Minnesota House of Representatives, the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Governor. The building also includes a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court, although court activities usually take place in the neighboring Minnesota Judicial Center. There have been three State Capitol buildings. The present building was designed by architect Cass Gilbert and completed in 1905. Its Beaux-Arts/American Renaissance design was influenced by the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and by McKim, Mead & White's Rhode Island State House. From 2013 to 2017 the building underwent an extensive restoration. This included replacing existing infrastructure; adding new mechanical systems; replacing or repairing tens of thousands of pieces of marble on the exterior; cleaning historic paintings, murals, and sculptures; and adding safety and accessibility features. The building is set in a landscaped campus with the Capitol Mall on its south front, Leif Erikson Park on its west, and Judicial Plaza to its east. Various monuments and memorials are located in these green spaces. == History == === First Minnesota State Capitol === The current State Capitol building is the third building to serve this purpose. The territorial legislature first met in a temporary headquarters in the Central House Hotel. In 1851, work began to oversee finances and the hiring of contractors to build the Capitol. Its architect, N. C. Prentiss drew up specifications for the new Capitol. Exterior details included brick work, cut stone floors and steps for the porches, a wood pediment, wood Ionic-style columns, and a well-framed roof covered with fireproof material. Interior work called for Norway pine flooring and staircases of oak and ash with oak handrails and turned balusters. The legislature moved into the new Capitol in time for the 5th territorial legislative session on January 4, 1854. The population boomed after Minnesota became a state on May 11, 1858, and the Capitol building was expanded with a new wing on the Exchange Street side of the building in 1873 and a second wing facing Wabasha Street in 1878. Despite efforts to make the Capitol fire-resistant, it was destroyed by fire on March 1, 1881. While legislators met in the evening, fire broke out in the dome of the Capitol and quickly spread. There were no deaths, but efforts to save the building failed. It was replaced on the same site in 1883 by the second Capitol building. === Second Minnesota State Capitol === After fire destroyed Minnesota's first Capitol building, the second Capitol, a three-story, Romanesque, masonry building designed by Leroy Buffington, was completed in 1883 on the site of the first Capitol. Buffington designed the new building in the shape of a Greek cross. It featured a foundation of cut stone and walls of red brick with Dresbach sandstone trim. Each wing measured 150 feet in length. The main entrance on the southwest from Wabasha Street opened onto the first floor, where the governor, attorney general, auditor, treasurer, and secretary of state had offices. The Assembly (House of Representatives) chamber in the southeast wing featured a twenty-five-foot ceiling with a large stained glass skylight. The Senate chamber in the southwest wing was finished in yellow birch and birdseye maple. The Supreme Court chamber in the southeast wing featured woodwork of cherry and Hungarian ash. Shortly after it opened, deficiencies of the new building were becoming clear. Overcrowding due to a lack of space, a lack of adequate fireproofing, and the discovery of dry rot made the building increasing unacceptable. Additionally, poor ventilation led in the push for a new Capitol building in 1893. It had served as the seat of Minnesota state government for just 10 years before state officials began planning a grander, m

Florida Governors Beginning with Governor Francis Fleming in the 1890s, every chief executive of Florida has had an official portrait painted and hung in the state capitol building. Over the years, an interesting variety of artistic styles has accumulated. In the mid-1950s, the state legislature commissioned Tallahassee artist Clarabel Jett (1908-96) to create oil-enhanced photographs of all Florida governors whose portraits were not yet in the state collection. In 1986, the legislature transferred custody of the portrait collection to the Museum of Florida History. All of the Governors' portraits are represented at the Historic Capitol. The more recent governors' portraits appear in the first-floor hallway of the new Capitol, beginning with Claude Kirk (1967-1971). In keeping with the tradition of official governors' portraits, our current governor, Ron DeSantis, will not commission his portrait until the end of his term. These are colorful portraits of colorful people, all of whom have been Florida history makers. Under Florida law, e-mail addresses are public records. If you do not want your e-mail address released in response to a public records request, do not send electronic mail to this entity. Instead, contact this office by phone or in writing.",1,1,5,1
29,what language do serbs speak?,Serbian,Serbian language,"Serbian (српски / srpski, pronounced [sr̩̂pskiː]) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian language mainly used by Serbs. It is the official and national language of Serbia, one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and co-official in Montenegro and Kosovo. It is a recognized minority language in Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Standard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian (more specifically on the dialects of Šumadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovina), which is also the basis of standard Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin varieties and therefore the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Montenegrins was issued in 2017. The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia, which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian. Serbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić, who created it based on phonemic principles. The Latin alphabet used for Serbian (latinica) was designed by the Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in the 1830s based on the Czech system with a one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correlation between the Cyrillic and Latin orthographies, resulting in a parallel system. == Classification == Serbian is a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian, a Slavic language (Indo-European), of the South Slavic subgroup. Other standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian are Bosnian, Croatian, and Montenegrin. ""An examination of all the major 'levels' of language shows that BCS is clearly a single language with a single grammatical system."" It has lower intelligibility with the Eastern South Slavic languages Bulgarian and Macedonian, than with Slovene (Slovene is part of the Western South Slavic subgroup, but there are still significant differences in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation to the standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian, although it is closer to the Kajkavian and Chakavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian). == Geographic distribution == Speakers by country: Serbia: 6,540,699 (official language) Bosnia and Herzegovina: 1,086,027 (co-official language) Germany: 568,240 Austria: 350,000 Montenegro: 269,307 (language in official use) Switzerland: 186,000 United States: 172,874 Sweden: 120,000 Italy: 106,498 Kosovo: est. 70.000–100.000 (co-official language) Canada: 72,690 Australia: 55,114 Croatia: 52,879 (recognized minority language) Slovenia: 38,964 North Macedonia: 24,773 (recognized minority language) Romania: 22,518 (recognized minority language) === Status in Montenegro === Serbian was the official language of Montenegro until October 2007, when the new Constitution of Montenegro replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties, Montenegrin was made the sole official language of the country, and Serbian was given the status of a language in official use along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian. In the 2023 Montenegrin census, 43.18% declared Serbian to be their native language, while Montenegrin was declared by 34.52% of the population. == Differences between standard Serbian and standard Croatian and Bosnian == == Writing system == Standard Serbian language uses both Cyrillic (ћирилица, ćirilica) and Latin script (latinica, латиница). Serbian is a rare example of synchronic digraphia, a situation where all literate members of a society have two interchangeable writing systems available to them. Media and publishers typically select one alphabet or the other. In general, the alphabets are used interchangeably; except in the legal sphere, where Cyrillic is required, there is no context where one alphabet or another predominates. Although Serbian language authorities have recognized the official status of both scripts in contemporary Standard Serbian for more

What are the Top 5+ Languages in Serbia? Is your language spoken in Serbia? There's a high possibility it is! And we're not talking about the fact that most young Serbians speak English. But for start, let's say something about the official languages in Serbia. The official language in Serbia is, of course, Serbian. The official script is the Cyrillic. The Latin script is also widely recognized. Nowadays, youth use the Latin script even more than Cyrillic because of its international character (and because of easier typing and switching to English keyboard). Can you guess how many minority languages there are in Serbia? There are fifteen of them! Minority languages in Serbia are in official use in parts of the country where the percentage of that particular minority exceeds 15%. The newest introduced minority language in Serbia is Bunjevac. It happened two years ago, in 2021. Bunjevac became the fourth official language in the northest Serbian town, Subotica. It means every street title sign in Subotica has to be written in four languages! The first name is in Serbian, then Hungarian, Croatian, and Bunjevac. The interesting thing is that Serbian, Croatian, and Bunjevac are languages so similar that you'd have to try hard not to understand the other two if you speak one of them. It seems funny, but for people from this town, it's a normal multicultural thing, where everyone's background is equally respected. Anyway, we went too far from our initial question. So, what are the top languages in Serbia? Let's find out! Can you guess the top three languages spoken in Serbia? Serbian Okay, this one was obvious, but we had to point it out. Of course, the official language of Serbia is Serbian. So, it is the most widely spoken language in the country. English Another safe bet. English is not a minority language in Serbia for obvious reasons of the English-speaking minority being inexistent. However, if you're visiting Serbia as a tourist and don't speak Serbian - English is the way to go. We may have a negligible number of native English speakers living in Serbia. But if you're trying to communicate with locals without the knowledge of Serbian, there's a high chance they know English. English is our second language in school. We start learning it from a very young age. However, don't be surprised if the generation of 1970s and older don't speak English. They mostly learned German and French during their school days. So, try to find people younger than 40 or 45 when asking for directions in English. If you're better in German, stick with those of 50 years or older. Hungarian We finally came to our first minority language in Serbia! Hungary is Serbia's northern neighbor, so it makes sense that most (almost all) Hungarians in Serbia live in our northern province - Vojvodina. Vojvodina was historically a part of Hungary, although many Serbs lived there. After WWI, in November of 1918, Vojvodina joined Serbia. Kingdom Yugoslavia was formed in the same year. Hungarians in Serbia, like other minorities, can school their children in their native language. It means that every school in every town where Hungarian is a minority language has one or more classes where all subjects are taught in Hungarian. The only difference is that they have an extra subject since the children get a grade from both - their mother tongue and Serbian. If this seems confusing, let us explain. A class in Serbia isn't the same as in the USA. All subjects are the same and mandatory. So, it's impossible to attend advanced math with certain people, and English with others. All children from the same class take every lesson together. Anyway, let's learn about Slavic languages in Serbia! Is your mother tongue one of the minority languages in Serbia? Other Slavic languages Other Slavic languages widely spoken in Serbia can be divided into two groups: the languages that fell into the Serbo-Croatian language in ex-Yugoslavia, and other Slavic languages. After Yugoslavia fell apart, every ex-republic wanted their language, just like they had their own nation. So, instead of one language (Serbo-Croatian), we now have Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. These four languages are the same in a linguistic context, but politically and officially separate. So, if you speak Serbian, you'll understand Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin perfectly. Maybe you'll miss a word here and there, but the differences aren't bigger than those of the Serbian dialects in the northern and southern parts of Serbia. Bunjevac is the closest to Serbian. We won't go into the linguistic history, but the Old Slavic language had one sound that turned into different sounds in different languages. While it gave e in Serbian, it gave i in Bunjevac. It doesn't mean that you should change every e in Serbian to get the Bunjevac language, but you can do it in some words. For example, while in Serbian we say, Mleko for milk, in Bunjevac, the same word will sound, Mliko. While Serbs and Macedonians can understand each other if they put in a bit of effort, other Slavic languages in Serbia aren't that similar to the official one? Bulgarian is the next closest to Serbian, but you'd have to speak Serbian perfectly and understand Slavic linguistics if you'd like to talk with a Bulgarian effortlessly. For other Slavic languages, you'll need language lessons! Albanian Albanian is widely spoken in Southern Serbia since most Albanians live in the Southern part of the country. Unfortunately, we don't have the exact data about the number of Albanian speakers in Serbia because of political reasons. Kosovo and Metohija, a Southern Serbian province, declared unilateral independence in 2008. From the total of 195 countries in the world, around 100 have recognized the independence of Kosovo. Serbia is, of course, not among them. But even if we don't take the Southern province into account for the lack of data, Albanian is a minority language in several municipalities in Serbia, such as Presevo, Bujanovac, and Medveda. Just like Hungarians and every other official minority in Serbia, they have the right to schooling, media, and administration in their native language. Where are minority languages in Serbia used? We mentioned that minorities in Serbia can choose to school their children in their mother language. But that's not all. There are media in minority languages. So, we have news, shows, newspapers, and so on in Bunjevac, Hungarian, Croatian, etc. The minority languages in Serbia are also used in administration. For example, if you're in a part of Serbia where Bulgarian is a minority language, you can ask for a birth certificate in that language. Did you know that Serbia has this many minority languages? Did you find your language among them? If you haven't and doesn't want to speak English in Serbia, the best solution is to learn Serbian! Choose one of our awesome Serbian teachers and book your private class now! Belgrade Language School BLS is a Serbian online language school with the mission to promote the Serbian language and culture among foreigners and heritage learners.

30,what money do i use in costa rica?,a) and b) to make it easier to understand the currency exchange rates.,Costa Rican colón,"Costa Rica Money and Tipping Customs in Costa Rica Exchanging Currency, ATM Machines, Using US Cash & Advice on Tipping Explore Vacation Options Colones to Dollars The official currency of Costa Rica is the Colon. Colones consist of colorful bills that depict some of Costa's Rica's most beautiful animals- these being sharks, monkeys, sloths and butterflies. They come in the amounts of 1000, 2000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 colones. The exchange rate between the dollar (USD) and the colon is always fluctuating and is currently around 612 colones to the dollar. For the most current exchange rates, check the site of the Central Bank of Costa Rica. The Colon The Costa Rica currency, the Colon, was named after Christopher Columbus, or Cristobal Colon. New colorful waterproof bank notes were released between 2012 and 2014. The bills come in denominations of C/1,000, C/2,000, C/5,000, C/10,000, and C/20,000, C/50,000 with coins of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 Colones. You might also notice that the bills are different sizes. That is actually a unique feature that helps people who are blind differentiate between each bill. The money system in Costa Rica is not too confusing, so you shouldn't be too worried about trying to figure it out. A quick reference point is that everything is a multiple of five. 500 colones is equivalent to approximately one dollar. Make sure you check the exchange rate before your trip. The exchange rate may go up or down, but it won't make that much difference in everyday purchases. 1,000 colones is about $2, 4,000 colones ~ $8, 5000 ~ $10. 10,000 colones ~ $20. A good trick is to look at the first number and double it to equal the approximate dollar amount. Using US Cash US dollars are widely accepted in Costa Rica. Bring smaller bills like $1, $5, $10 and $20 bills. The bills will need to be in good condition as they will not be accepted if they are ripped or torn. The larger the bill, the more perfect it needs to be. Bills larger than $20 are difficult and might have to be changed at a bank. You will most likely receive your change in the local currency: colones. Euros are not widely accepted in Costa Rica. Exchanging US Dollars To Costa Rican Money When you arrive, you may exchange your money for official currency at any local bank. Some upscale hotels will also exchange money for their guests. Note that you will get a more favorable exchange rate from banks. Do not exchange money inside the airport. You'll see money changing kiosks as soon as you exit the baggage claim area, but it's best to walk right past it. The exchange rate at the kiosks in the Costa Rica airports is notoriously terrible. You can also exchange money at your own bank in your home country for a good rate. They will just have to order the colones, so plan on exchanging your money a few weeks ahead of time. Travel Tip: If you are making a smaller purchase at a local convenient store or soda, try not to pay with large colones bill. For example, if you want to buy a Casado for 2,500 colones, try not to us a 20,000 colones bill. Ticos tend to get annoyed because they don't want to break that much change. Although if you are insistent, they will usually help you. Travel Tip: Most places accept credit and debt cards. Just check with your bank about any possible fee you might have to pay to use your card internationally. Travel Tip: Leave your travelers checks at home. They are not as widely accepted as cash or credit cards. The main color of the 1,000 colones banknote is red. On the reverse, you can see a dry forest with a Guanacaste tree, a white-tailed deer and a Costa Rican nightblooming cactus. The observe shows Braulio Carrillo Colina, who was the Head of State of Costa Rica between 1835-1837 and 1838-1842, as well as the 1840-1842 Costa Rican coat of arms. The main color of the 2,000 colones banknote is blue. On the reverse, you can see a coral reef, a bull shark, a red cushion sea star and a slimy sea plume. The observe shows Mauro Fernandez Acuna, who was a lawyer and politician, as well as the Colegio Superior de Senoritas. The main color of the 5,000 colones banknote is yellow. On the reverse, you can see a mangrove swamp, a white-headed capuchin monkey, a mangrove crab and a red mangrove. The observe shows Alfredo Gonzalez Flores, who served as President of Costa Rica from 1914 to 1917, as well as the Banco International de Costa Rica building in San Jose. The main color of the 10,000 colones banknote is green. On the reverse, you can see a rainforest, a brown-throated sloth, a cup fungi and a eriopsis orchid. The observe shows Jose Figueres Ferrer, who served as President of Costa Rica on three occasions, as well as the Abolition of the Army. The main color of the 20,000 colones banknote is orange. On the reverse, you can see Paramo, a volcano hummingbird, a sunflower and coffee plants. On the observe, you can see Carmen Lyra, the first prominent female Costa Rican writer, as well as an outline of Costa Rica and a rabbit stroking a wolf from Lyra's ""Cuentos De Mi Tia Panchita"" (Tales of My Aunt Panchita). The main color of the 50,000 colones banknote is violet. On the reverse, you can see a cloud forest, a parasol mushroom, a bromelia flower and a morpho butterfly. It shows Ricardo Jimenez Oreamuno, who served as president of Costa Rica three times and also served the Supreme Court in San Jose. ATM Machines You may get local colones using your ATM card. It's important that you know the exchange rate before you do this. You should check with your bank regarding their policy for foreign ATMs, fees, limitations, etc. Local ATM's fees will vary, just like at home. Be mindful when using ATMs and make sure that you are in a safe area. Some ATMs will let you withdraw dollars, but not all of them. Credit Cards Credit cards are widely accepted by most businesses in Costa Rica. Contact your credit card providers to let them know you are traveling and ask them if any foreign transaction fees apply. Sometimes you will get a better price paying in cash rather than use a card, especially when you are negotiating. Cost of Traveling in Costa Rica Costa Rica is regularly voted as the happiest country on earth, based on its life expectancy, lifestyle, values, and its environmental sustainability. Every year more people come to visit this little country for its natural beauty and eco-friendly attitude. Those who travel on a shoestring budget can survive on $50 a day. Top-notch hotels can charge up to $500 or more. Prices of luxury hotels and tours are in dollars, and dollars are widely accepted, but it is useful to have some Colones on hand. Shopping in Costa Rica Shopping for clothes and food in Costa Rica is not as cheap as you might expect. Most prices are actually similar to prices in the US or UK. Clothes, in particular, are expensive in Costa Rica. Supermarkets now offer a wider selection of local and imported food and a good selection of wine. It is significantly more costly than in the US, especially for imported items. Shopping in the center of San Jose, like at the Central Market on Avenida Central, is cheaper than in the flashy Malls of the Suburbs, and this is also where you will find typical artisans and souvenirs. The most economical places to shop for fresh foods, meats, fish fruits, and vegetables are at outdoor ferias (farmer's markets). They are usually open in the mornings on weekends. We suggest having a meal at a traditional soda too! Sodas are ""mom and pop shops"" that traditionally serve the famous Costa Rican casado, or ""married man's meal."" It's served with chicken, fish, pork or beef, rice, beans, salad, plantains and fresh juice! Bring cash because it will be cheap! Tipping in Costa Rica Unfortunately, there is no definitive guide for Tipping in Costa Rica, and it's a hard topic as people have different opinions on when and how much to tip. Tips are appreciated, and your guides and drivers will be used to receiving them from tourists. Drivers & Guides: Depending on how much time and effort each guide or driver spent with you, $10, $20 or $40 is certainly appreciated based on the level of service you feel you received. Taxis: Tipping taxi drivers are almost unheard of, but if you feel the urge, it will be well received! Restaurants: Leaving a tip is not required for servers. Restaurants in Costa Rica add a 10% service charge to your bill. If you receive exceptional service, we recommend leaving an additional 10%. Hotels: For porters, 500 colones (about $1) per bag is a fair gratuity. Above all, we hope that you find this information useful and that you are getting excited about your upcoming trip to Costa Rica.

Costa Rica Money The Costa Rican unit of currency is the colon. Named after Christopher Columbus, the first European to visit Costa Rica, the colon has a value that fluctuates between 500-550 colones per 1 US dollar. The cost of travel in Costa Rica is higher than other countries in Central America, but is still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe. History The Spanish introduced the first real currency to Costa Rica in the 16th century. Known as pesos, these coins were originally manufactured in Spain and transported to Costa Rica, but were later minted in Peru after gold and silver mines were discovered here. The two original denominations - the golden ""Escudo"" and the silver ""Real"" - were used for exchanges, with the ""Real"" being used for most daily transactions. Following Costa Rica's independence from Spain in 1821, it joined the Federal Republic of Central America and adopted the Republic's currency. After Costa Rica separated from the Republic in 1838, its currency again changed. The change was reflected in the coin design, which used coffee and tobacco symbols, the two main exports at the time. When the Republic of Costa Rica was officially declared in 1848, new symbols - a flag and a shield - were adopted and have continued to be used since. In 1993, Costa Rica began printing the so-called ""new currency,"" which cost much less to manufacture. Still in use today, this currency consists of golden coins made of bronze coated steel, in addition to 5 and 10 colones coins made from aluminum. Stability The only thing you need to worry about during your holiday in Costa Rica is enjoying yourself. Not only is the Costa Rican government stable, the nation is known as the most stable country in Central and Latin America. This stability carries over into Costa Rica's economy; you will have no difficulty accessing money in Costa Rica upon your arrival or departure. Practical Matters US dollars are widely accepted in Costa Rica, especially at upscale hotels and restaurants--some places even list their prices in US dollars to make it easier for international travelers. For smaller services (including local meals or public transportation), be prepared to pay with colones. Costs Budget travelers can survive on around US$30 to US$40 a day. This covers basic transportation, lodging, and food. Rooms in budget hotels usually run around US$10 to US$20 per person and may include private or shared bathrooms. Meals at local restaurants (called sodas) usually go for around US$3 to US$4. Midrange travelers usually spend US$50 to US$100 per person per day. Hotels in this range are more comfortable and offer a good list of amenities; these usually go for around US$30 to US$80 a night. Restaurants in this category offer meals for US$5 to US$10. High-end travelers will find a number of upscale hotels and restaurants in Costa Rica. Nicer hotels start at around US$90 and are often found in more developed areas, although there are some impressive eco-lodges in remote destinations. Meals at the best restaurants begin at around US$20. Hotels are generally more expensive during the dry season (December to April) and holidays, including Christmas, New Years, and Semana Santa. Banks, ATMs and Money Colones come in paper denominations of 1.000, 2.000, 5.000, 10.000, 20.000, and 50.000. Coins come in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500. Older coins are silver and slightly larger than the newer versions. Most of the newer coins are gold-colored, except for the 5 and 10 colones coins, which are silver. Expect little difficulty when it comes to exchanging money in Costa Rica. All banks will exchange US dollars and many will exchange British pounds or euros. Travelers checks can be cashed at banks or exchange bureaus for a commission of 1% to 3%. Some hotels accept travelers checks for payment, but many do not. ATMs (known as cajeros automaticos) are widely available in Costa Rica. Some banks charge a fee for using an ATM abroad, so check with your bank before traveling to Costa Rica. Credit cards are widely accepted at midrange and upscale hotels and restaurants. Most credit cards include a transaction fee for international purchases. Credit cards are widely accepted throughout the country, but there will still be occasions when only cash will do. We recommend reading our article ""Are Credit Cards Accepted?"" to learn when and where credit and debit cards are appropriate. This article will also help you better determine how much cash you may need throughout your trip. Taxes and Tipping There is a 13% tax on all purchases in Costa Rica, including souvenirs, food, and hotels. Hotels add an additional 3% tourist surcharge and most restaurants include a 10% gratuity fee. You are not obligated to tip on top of this, but it's good practice to do so, because the 10% fee is split among many people. If you want to tip your waiter directly, leave more money on the table. You may want to tip other people while in Costa Rica, including maids, bellhops, or drivers. Tips for these services usually range from US$1 to US$10 a day. Taxi drivers do not expect a tip.

Costa Rica Currency: Money, Tipping, & Exchanging on Vacation When getting ready for a vacation in Costa Rica, there is plenty to consider. Between keeping an eye on your destination's weather, packing for your various excursions, and making sure your passports are all in order, the process can quickly become overwhelming! However, one of the most important things that you should focus on while preparing for travel? Money. To get by, you'll need to understand the basics of Costa Rica currency, tipping customs, and where and when to exchange money - among other things. Our Costa Rica Experts cover this information with all our travelers before departure. But for those of you doing your own research into travel to Costa Rica, here's a simplified rundown to make your getaway preparations easier. Colones: The Basics The official Costa Rican currency is the colon (plural colones). The symbol is CL. Costa Rica's New Colorful Currency Entered the Scene in 2012. Costa Rica phased out their old bills and put into circulation the following new colorful banknotes inspired by the country's celebrated wildlife: The 1,000-colon banknotes (deer) The 2,000-colon banknotes (shark) The 5,000-colon banknotes (monkey) The 10,000 colon banknotes (sloth) The 20,000-colon banknotes (hummingbird) There was also previously a 50,000-colon morpho butterfly bank note, but it has been taken out of circulation and is no longer accepted. Money FAQs: It's important to have your finances in order before a trip. Between notifying credit cards and tipping, there's plenty to take care of before you go. Allow us to demystify any confusion surrounding Costa Rican currency. And if you have any more questions, please feel free to ask an Expert well before take-off. Does Costa Rica take US dollars? The Costa Rica Colon is preferred, but US dollars are widely accepted. We recommend traveling with small denominations of US dollars for tipping purposes. Generally, bills larger than $20 are not accepted. Even if you use the USD, you will likely receive your change in colones. Credit card payment is widely accepted, most commonly MasterCard, Visa, and American Express, but the further off-grid you get, the less likely. You'll want to tell your credit card company that you'll be in Costa Rica before your trip to ensure your cards work without issue. If you plan on driving, you will want to have a variety of Costa Rica colones (bills and coins) with you as there may be toll roads along your route. Your wallet may feel a bit stuffed with all the cards and currencies you're keeping track of, but having a few different methods of payment on hand is going to save you time and stress. What is the exchange rate? At any given time, you can calculate $1 US Dollar (USD) to the Costa Rican Colon (CRC) here, or any other country currency for that matter. A quick google search will also do the trick. As of Feb 20, 2023, we are looking at 1 USD to 559.3417 CRC. Where can I exchange money in Costa Rica? We suggest waiting until you get to Costa Rica for the best exchange rate. You can do it upon arrival at the airport, which is usually the simplest option as you can exchange your cash before you even step foot outside. You can also make your exchange at some high-end hotels, but they may not have the most favorable rate. Money exchange is also provided at most banks and ATMs, although ATMs may be unreliable. Look into fees your bank may charge as they tend to be higher for international transactions. Please note: to exchange money in Costa Rica, you'll need to bring your passport. Should I tip? Tipping is really up to you based on your overall experience, the level of service, and your budget. Nobody should expect a tip, but it is a thoughtful way to reward someone for their experience, knowledge, and help. Restaurant bills include 10% gratuities, but it is perfectly acceptable to leave extra for good service. However, it is worth noting that tipping in Costa Rica is not considered a requirement the way it is in the United States. How much is the tax in Costa Rica? A 13% value-added tax (VAT) is charged on professional services in Costa Rica. There's an additional 10% service tax added to meals as a tip for the staff. Hotels are subject to a 13% sales tax on room charges. Just Some Fun Currency Facts The new bills are also different sizes, which enables those without sight to differentiate between bills. The banknotes change colors. The Colon's named for a famous historical figure. The name Colon comes from Christopher Columbus, Cristobal Colon in Spanish. The bills were once made of cotton and plastic, but have since switched to entirely plastic for security reasons. The colones feature a national figurehead on one side and an animal on the other. Personally, I'm here for the animals. About Sarah Mayo Sarah is no stranger to travel - a natural curiosity about the world inspired her to pursue a degree in tourism.

31,when did the libyan conflict start?,2011,2011,"The Chadian–Libyan War was a series of military campaigns in Chad between 1978 and 1987, fought between Libyan and allied Chadian forces against Chadian groups supported by France, with the occasional involvement of other foreign countries and factions. Libya had been involved in Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before Muammar Gaddafi's rise to power in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the Chadian Civil War to northern Chad in 1968. The conflict was marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980–1981 and 1983–1987. On all of these occasions, Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the French government, which intervened militarily to support the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986. The pattern of the war delineated itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed the bulk of the scouting and fighting. This pattern was radically changed in 1986, towards the end of the war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity never previously witnessed in Chad. This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now by the United States, Zaire and France with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in air and other firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict. Gaddafi initially intended to annex the Aouzou Strip, the northernmost part of Chad, which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period. In 1972 his goals became, in the evaluation of historian Mario Azevedo, the creation of a client state in Libya's ""underbelly"", an Islamic republic modelled after his Jamahiriya, that would maintain close ties with Libya, and secure his control over the Aouzou Strip; expulsion of the French from the region; and use of Chad as a base to expand his influence in Central Africa. == Background == === Occupation of the Aouzou Strip === Libyan involvement with Chad can be said to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between the two sides of the Chad–Libya border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies. All this changed with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in northern Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces. Though initially wary of the FROLINAT, Gaddafi had come to see by 1970 the organization as useful to his needs. With the support of Soviet bloc nations, particularly East Germany, he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding. On 27 August 1971 Chad accused Egypt and Libya of backing a coup against then-president François Tombalbaye by recently amnestied Chadians. On the day of the failed coup, Tombalbaye cut all diplomatic relations with Libya and Egypt, and invited all Libyan opposition groups to base themselves in Chad, and started laying claims t

In early 2011, amid a wave of popular protest in countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa, largely peaceful demonstrations against entrenched regimes brought quick transfers of power in Egypt and Tunisia. In Libya, however, an uprising against the four-decade rule of Muammar al-Qaddafi led to civil war and international military intervention. In this special feature, Britannica provides a guide to recent events in Libya and explores the historical and geographic context of the conflict. Uprising On February 15, 2011, anti-government rallies were held in Benghazi by protesters angered by the arrest of a human rights lawyer, Fethi Tarbel. The protesters called for Qaddafi to step down and for the release of political prisoners. Libyan security forces used water cannons and rubber bullets against the crowds, resulting in a number of injuries. To counter the demonstrations further, a pro-government rally orchestrated by the Libyan authorities was broadcast on state television. As the protests intensified, with demonstrators taking control of Benghazi and unrest spreading to Tripoli, the Libyan government began using lethal force against demonstrators. Security forces and squads of mercenaries fired live ammunition into crowds of demonstrators. Demonstrators also were attacked with tanks and artillery and from the air with warplanes and helicopter gunships. The regime restricted communications, blocking the Internet and interrupting telephone service throughout the country. On February 21 one of Qaddafi's sons, Sayf al-Islam, gave a defiant address on state television, blaming outside agitators for the unrest and saying that further demonstrations could lead to civil war in the country. He vowed that the regime would fight ""to the last bullet."" The government's sudden escalation of violence against protesters and other civilians drew international condemnation from foreign leaders and human rights organizations. It also seemed to damage the coherence of the regime, causing a number of high-level officials--including the minister of justice and a number of senior Libyan diplomats, including the Libyan ambassador to the United Nations--to resign in protest or issue statements condemning the regime. A number of Libyan embassies around the world began to fly Libya's pre-Qaddafi flag, signaling support for the uprising. Support for Qaddafi also seemed to waver in some segments of the military; as the Libyan air force carried out attacks against demonstrators, two Libyan fighter pilots flew their jets to Malta, choosing to defect rather than obey orders to bomb Benghazi. On February 22 Qaddafi delivered an angry, rambling speech on state television, condemning the protesters as traitors and calling on his supporters to fight them. The speech took place in the Bab al-'Aziziyyah compound, Qaddafi's primary headquarters in Tripoli, in front of a building that still showed extensive damage from a 1986 air strike by the United States. He resisted calls to step down and vowed to remain in Libya. Although he denied having used force against protesters, he repeatedly vowed to use violence to remain in power. Clashes continued, and Qaddafi's hold on power weakened as Libyan military units increasingly sided with the opposition against the regime. As demonstrators acquired weapons from government arms depots and joined forces with defected military units, the anti-Qaddafi movement began to take the form of an armed rebellion. The newly armed rebel forces were able to expel most pro-Qaddafi troops from the eastern portion of Libya, including the city of Benghazi, and many western cities by February 23. The Libyan-Egyptian border was opened, allowing foreign journalists into the country for the first time since the conflict began. Pro-Qaddafi paramilitary units continued to hold the city of Tripoli, where Qaddafi and members of his family and inner circle remained. As Qaddafi massed his forces in the Tripoli area to hold off the rebels there, his public statements seemed to indicate that he was becoming increasingly isolated and desperate. Speaking by telephone on Libyan state television on February 24, Qaddafi once again lashed out at protesters, saying that the young people at the core of the protest movement were acting under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs and that the demonstrations were being controlled by al-Qaeda. Foreign leaders continued to condemn the violence. However, international efforts to intervene or pressure the regime to end the bloodshed were complicated by the presence of many foreign nationals in Libya still waiting to be evacuated. The regime continued its efforts to hold the capital, launching attacks around Tripoli, some of which were repelled by rebel forces. On February 25 pro-Qaddafi gunmen in Tripoli attacked unarmed protesters and others as they emerged from mosques after Friday prayers. International pressure for Qaddafi to step down increased as violence continued and foreign nationals were evacuated. The UN Security Council unanimously approved a measure that included exacting sanctions against the Qaddafi regime, imposing a travel ban and an arms embargo, and freezing the Qaddafi family's assets. The measure also referred the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The United States, the European Union (EU), and a number of other countries also imposed sanctions. On February 28 the United States announced that it had frozen at least $30 billion in Libyan assets. Amid continuing skirmishes as rebel forces strengthened their positions outside Tripoli, Qaddafi invited a number of Western journalists to the city in an attempt to demonstrate that the situation remained under control in the capital. In interviews he continued to blame al-Qaeda and hallucinogenic drugs for the uprising. He claimed that Western leaders who had called for him to step down had done so out of a desire to colonize Libya, and he insisted that he was still well loved by Libyans. A rebel leadership council, formed by the merger of local rebel groups, appeared in Benghazi in early March. Known as the Transitional National Council (TNC), it declared that its aims would be to act as the rebellion's military leadership and as the representative of the Libyan opposition, provide services in rebel-held areas, and guide the country's transition to democratic government. Conditions in Libya worsened as the armed struggle continued, and thousands of people, mostly migrant workers from Egypt and Tunisia, fled toward the borders. Governments and humanitarian organizations began to organize efforts to address worsening shortages of food, fuel, and medical supplies throughout the country. Benghazi, Libya: protests in 2011Protesters at a rally in Benghazi in March 2011 carrying the Libyan flag that was used from 1951 to 1969. The flag was adopted by the rebels in 2011. After the rebels succeeded in taking control of eastern Libya and a number of cities in the west, the conflict appeared to enter a stalemate. The Qaddafi regime still controlled enough soldiers and weapons to hold Tripoli and to stage fresh assaults, which rebel fighters, although poorly equipped, were largely able to repel. Most fighting took place in the towns around Tripoli and in the central coastal region, where rebels and Qaddafi loyalists battled for control of the oil-export terminals on the Gulf of Sidra. As the fighting continued, forces loyal to Qaddafi seemed to gain momentum, launching successful assaults to retake control in strategic areas around Tripoli and on the coast of the Gulf of Sidra. Attacking with fighter jets, tanks, and artillery, pro-Qaddafi forces had by March 10 driven rebel forces from Zawiyah, west of Tripoli, and from the oil-export centre of Ras Lanuf. Those gains highlighted the Qaddafi loyalists' advantages in weaponry, training, and organization. As Qaddafi appeared to gain the upper hand, the international community continued to debate possible diplomatic and military responses to the rapidly developing conflict. Countries worked to establish contact with the TNC, although only France granted it official recognition, announcing on March 10 that it would treat the council as Libya's legitimate government. International condemnation of the Qaddafi regime continued to build, and, at an emergency summit on March 11, the EU unanimously called for Qaddafi to step down. However, the international community remained divided over the possibility of military intervention--most likely by imposing a no-fly zone over Libya, a measure long requested by the rebels to prevent Qaddafi loyalists from launching air attacks. Some countries, including France and the United Kingdom, signaled their support for such an operation, while others, including the United States and Germany, expressed their reservations, emphasizing the need for broad international consensus and warning against possible unforeseen consequences of military intervention. The African Union (AU) rejected any military intervention in Libya, asserting that the crisis should be resolved through negotiations, whereas the Arab League passed a resolution on March 13 calling on the UN Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya. On March 15 Qaddafi loyalists launched a heavy assault on the eastern city of Ajdabiya, the last large rebel-held city on the route to Benghazi. On March 17, as Qaddafi loyalists advanced on the remaining rebel positions in Benghazi and Tobruk in the east and Misurata in the west, the UN Security Council voted 10-0--with abstentions from Russia, China, Germany, India, and Brazil--to authorize military action, including imposition of a no-fly zone to protect Libyan civilians. The Qaddafi regime responded by declaring an immediate cease-fire, although there were reports that pro-Qaddafi forces continued to launch attacks after the announcement and that heavy fighting continued in Benghazi. Beginning March 19, a coalition of U.S. and European forces with warplanes and cruise missiles attacked targets in Libya in an effort to disable Libya's air force and air defense systems so that the UN-authorized no-fly zone could be imposed. Coalitionmissiles struck buildings in a compound used by Qaddafi as a command centre, and in eastern Libya warplanes attacked a pro-Qaddafi armoured column positioned outside Benghazi. Emboldened by the air strikes, rebel forces once again launched an offensive to challenge pro-Qaddafi forces' hold on the oil centres on the coast. Qaddafi denounced the coalition attacks as an act of aggression against Libya and vowed to continue fighting international forces and the rebels. Coalition spokesmen announced on March 23 that the Libyan air force had been completely disabled by coalition air strikes. However, heavy fighting continued on the ground. Pro-Qaddafi units massed around the rebel-held city of Misurata in the west and the contested city of Ajdabiya in the east, shelling both heavily and causing significant civilian casualties. Attacks by coalition warplanes soon weakened pro-Qaddafi ground forces in eastern Libya, allowing rebels to advance west again. On March 27 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) officially took command of military operations previously directed by the United States, France, and the United Kingdom in Libya. The handover came after several days of debate between NATO countries over the limits of international military intervention; several countries had argued that the coalition's aggressive targeting of pro-Qaddafi ground forces had exceeded the mandate set by the UN Security Council to protect civilians. On March 30 Libyan foreign minister Moussa Koussa defected, fleeing to the United Kingdom. The defection of Koussa, a former head of Libyan intelligence and a longtime member of Qaddafi's inner circle, was interpreted as a sign that support for Qaddafi among senior Libyan officials was beginning to wane. As the fighting progressed, it began to appear that, even with NATO attacks on pro-Qaddafi forces, the Libyan rebels--a poorly armed and disorganized force with little military training--would be unable to oust Qaddafi or achieve decisive successes against Qaddafi's professional troops. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis intensified, with an AU delegation traveling to Tripoli on April 10 to present a cease-fire plan to Qaddafi. AU representatives announced that Qaddafi had accepted the plan, although pro-Qaddafi forces continued to launch attacks on April 11. The plan was rejected by the rebel leaders on the grounds that it did not provide for Qaddafi's departure from Libya. As the stalemate continued, the United Kingdom announced on April 19 that it would send a team of military liaison officers to Libya to advise rebel leaders on military strategy, organization, and logistics. The next day France and Italy announced that they would also send advisers. All three countries specified that their officers would not participate in fighting. The Libyan foreign minister condemned the decision to send military advisers, saying that such aid to the rebels would only prolong the conflict. NATO attacks continued and targeted a number of sites associated with Qaddafi and members of his inner circle, such as the Bab al-'Aziziyyah compound in Tripoli, drawing protests from Libyan officials who charged that NATO had adopted a strategy of trying to kill Qaddafi. His son Sayf al-Arab and three of Qaddafi's grandchildren were killed in a NATO air strike in April. In June the ICC issued arrest warrants for Qaddafi, his son Sayf al-Islam, and the Libyan intelligence chief, Abdullah Senussi, for ordering attacks against civilians during the uprising. Some observers expressed concern that the ICC's proceedings against Qaddafi would discourage him from relinquishing power voluntarily. In spite of pressure from NATO attacks, rebel advances in the eastern and western regions of Libya, and the Qaddafi regime's international isolation, Qaddafi continued to hold power in Tripoli. After months of stalemate, the balance of power once again shifted in the rebels' favour. In August 2011 rebel forces advanced to the outskirts of Tripoli, taking control of strategic areas, including the city of Zawiyah, the site of one of Libya's largest oil refineries. Rebels soon advanced into Tripoli, establishing control over some areas of the capital on August 22. As rebel fighters battled pro-Qaddafi forces for control of Tripoli, Qaddafi's whereabouts were unknown. The next day rebel forces appeared to gain the upper hand, capturing the Bab al-'Aziziyyah compound, Qaddafi's headquarters. Rebels raised Libya's pre-Qaddafi flag over the compound as jubilant crowds destroyed symbols of Qaddafi. Fighting between rebels and loyalists continued in a few areas of Tripoli. By early September rebel forces had solidified their control of Tripoli, and the TNC began to transfer its operations to the capital. Qaddafi, effectively forced from power, remained in hiding, occasionally issuing defiant audio messages. Rebel forces focused their attention on the few remaining cities under loyalist control, attempting to use negotiations to persuade loyalist commanders to surrender peacefully and avoid a bloody ground assault. When negotiations failed, rebel troops began to push into the cities of Sirte and Bani Walid, engaging in heavy fighting with loyalists. The TNC achieved new international legitimacy on September 15 when the UN General Assembly voted to recognize it as the representative of the Libyan people in the UN. On October 20 Qaddafi was discovered and killed by rebel fighters in his hometown, Sirte, as they fought to solidify their control of the city. The TNC struggled to establish a functional government and exert its authority in the months that followed the fall of the Qaddafi regime. Local rebel militias that had fought autonomously during the uprising, especially those in western Libya, were reluctant to submit to an interim government formed in eastern Libya with little input from the rest of the country and were suspicious of some TNC officials' past ties to the Qaddafi regime. The militias refused to disarm, and skirmishes between rival militias over territory were common.",5,1,5,1
32,who plays edward scissorhands?,Johnny Depp,Johnny Depp,"Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American gothic romantic fantasy film directed by Tim Burton. It was produced by Burton and Denise Di Novi, written by Caroline Thompson from a story by her and Burton, and starring Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin. It tells the story of an unfinished artificial humanoid who has scissor blades instead of hands, is taken in by a suburban family, and falls in love with their teenage daughter. Burton conceived Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros. declined. Edward Scissorhands was then fast-tracked after Burton's critical and financial success with Batman. The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman, and was Vincent Price's last film role to be released in his lifetime. Edward Scissorhands was a critical and commercial success, grossing over four times its $20 million budget. The film won the British Academy Film Award for Best Production Design and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, in addition to receiving multiple nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and the Saturn Awards. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work. == Plot == One snowy evening, an elderly woman tells her granddaughter the bedtime story of a young man named Edward, who has scissor blades for hands. Many years earlier, Peg Boggs, a local door-to-door Avon saleswoman, not having any luck in her own neighborhood, tries to sell at the decrepit Gothic mansion where Edward lives. The creation of an old inventor, Edward is an ageless humanoid. The inventor homeschooled Edward but died from a heart attack before giving Edward hands, leaving him unfinished. Peg finds Edward alone and offers to take him to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Edward falls in love with Kim, despite her initial fear of him. As their neighbors are curious about the new houseguest, the Boggs throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming him. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's supercilious boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries, progressing to grooming dogs and later styling the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon so he can support himself. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce him, but scares him away. Joyce lies to the neighborhood women that Edward forced himself on her, reducing their trust in him. Edward's dream of opening the salon is ruined when the bank refuses him a loan on the grounds that he has no assessment and collateral and is not legally a human. Jealous of Kim's attraction to Edward, Jim takes advantage of his naivety by asking him to pick the lock on his parents' home so he can steal his father's electronic goods and sell them to buy a van. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered and walls come down, trapping Edward inside. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that a lifetime of isolation has left Edward without any common sense or morality; thus, he cannot be criminally charged. Edward nevertheless takes responsibility for the robbery, telling Kim that he did it because she asked him to. Consequently, he is shunned by the entire neighborhood except for the Boggs family. At Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice sculpture modeled after Kim; the ice shavings are thrown into the air and fall like snow, something that has never happened

Darth Vader () is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He was first introduced in the original film trilogy as one of the leaders of the Galactic Empire. The prequel trilogy chronicles his transformation from the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. His metamorphosis begins when he is lured to the dark side of the Force by Chancellor Palpatine, who later becomes the Emperor. After a lightsaber battle with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader is severely injured and is transformed into a cyborg. He serves Palpatine for over two decades, hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel Alliance. When Palpatine tries to kill Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, the Sith Lord turns against his master and destroys him. Vader is the husband of Padmé Amidala, the father of Luke and his twin sister Leia Organa, and the grandfather of Ben Solo (later known as Kylo Ren). David Prowse physically portrays Vader in the original trilogy, while James Earl Jones provides his voice in all of the films and some television series. Sebastian Shaw portrays Anakin in Return of the Jedi (1983), while Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen portray Anakin in the prequel trilogy, with Christensen reprising the role in the series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and Ahsoka (2023). In the standalone film Rogue One (2016), Vader is portrayed by Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous. The character also appears in novels, comics, and video games. He has become an iconic villain of cinema. == Creation and development == === Darth Vader === As part of the development for the original Star Wars film, George Lucas hired the artist Ralph McQuarrie to create conceptual images for the characters. For Vader, Lucas asked McQuarrie to depict a ""very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind."" Because the script described Vader traveling between spaceships, McQuarrie suggested that he should wear a space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie created Vader's iconic mask by combining a full-face breathing mask with a samurai helmet. A 1975 production painting by McQuarrie depicts Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller, who later became Luke Skywalker. Vader is shown wearing black armor, a flowing cape and a skull-like mask and helmet. This early design was similar to Vader's final appearance. Working from McQuarrie's concepts, the costume designer John Mollo devised an outfit that combined clerical robes, a motorcycle suit, a German military helmet, and a military gas mask. The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armor. The sound of Vader's breathing was created by the film's sound designer, Ben Burtt, using modified recordings of a scuba breathing apparatus. The sound effect is trademarked at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Lucas has provided differing accounts of how the name ""Darth Vader"" originated. In a 2005 interview with Rolling Stone, he claimed it was a modified version of ""Dark Father."" On another occasion, he said it was inspired by the phrase ""Dark Water"". It is also possible that ""Darth Vader"" originated from the name of Gary Vader, a boy who went to high school with Lucas. The names of various Star Wars characters have been altered in countries outside the United States. In France, Vader's name was changed to Dark Vador (pronounced [daʁk vadɔʁ]) starting with the original film. Although the names of some other characters have been reverted to the English versions over the years, Vader is still referred to as Dark Vador in recent French-language Star Wars media. The title ""Darth"" has been replaced with ""Dark"" for other Sith Lords as well. In Italian-language editions of Star Wars films, Darth Vader was called Dart Fener (pronounced [ˌdar(t) ˈfɛːner]) starting with the original trilogy. In 2004, the dubbing director for the Italian-language version of Revenge of the Sith (2005) asked Italian fans to decide which name to use in the film; the Italian name

David Charles Prowse (1 July 1935 – 28 November 2020) was an English actor, bodybuilder, strongman and weightlifter. He portrayed Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy and a manservant in Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange. In 2015, he starred in two documentaries concerning his Darth Vader role, one titled The Force's Mouth, which included Prowse voicing Darth Vader's lines with studio effects applied for the first time, and the other titled I Am Your Father, covering the subject of the fallout between Prowse and Lucasfilm. Prior to his role as Vader, Prowse had established himself as a super-hero figure in the United Kingdom as the Green Cross Man in Green Cross Code media aimed at teaching children and young people road safety. == Early life == David Charles Prowse was born on 1 July 1935 in Bristol, England. He was the son of Gladys (née Burt) and Charles Prowse. He was brought up on the Southmead housing estate in Bristol, gaining a scholarship to Bristol Grammar School. Prowse was tall, standing 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), and developed an interest in bodybuilding. His early jobs included a bouncer at a dance hall, where he met his future wife, at Henleaze Swimming Pool. Following his successes from 1961 in the British heavyweight weightlifting championship, he left Bristol in 1963 to work for a London weightlifting company. == Career == === Weightlifting and training === Prowse won the British heavyweight weightlifting championship in 1962. The following two years he represented England in the weightlifting event at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia. During his bodybuilding course, Prowse became friends with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno. Prowse could deadlift as much as 784 lb (356 kg) and was notable for being the first person to lift the Dinnie Stones. During his prime, Prowse weighed around 282 pounds (128 kg). During the 1970s, Prowse developed a minor interest with wrestling and trained many British wrestlers of the time. Prowse helped to train Christopher Reeve for the lead role in Superman (1978) after lobbying for the part himself. In a television interview, he related how his response to being told ""we've found our Superman"" was ""Thank you very much."" Only then was he told that Reeve had been chosen for the role and he was to only be a trainer. He trained Cary Elwes for his role as Westley in The Princess Bride (1987). Prowse also became fitness consultant to Harrods, ripped up phone books under the stage name 'Jack the Ripper', and opened a series of gyms, including The Dave Prowse Fitness Centre in Southwark, London. Notably, Arnold Schwarzenegger sometimes trained at Prowse's gym and the British bodybuilder was also a judge at the last Mr. Universe contest Schwarzenegger won. After making his last professional film appearance as Vader in 1983, he returned his major focus on weightlifting and continued to appear on some strength demonstrations in the United Kingdom until the late 1990s. === Acting === His first appearance is a brief cameo in a gym as a weightlifter in the 1968 TV show The Champions: the opening sequence of episode 2 ""The Invisible Man"". Also in 1968, he was cast as kilt wearing and bagpipe playing Emlyn MacGregor in The Beverly Hillbillies episode ""Coming Through the Rye"" (season 7 episode 4). He made an appearance as henchman Tony in the 1969 TV show The Saint (series 6 episode 20) starring Roger Moore. In the United Kingdom, Prowse was well known as the Green Cross Man, a superhero invented to promote a road safety campaign for children in 1975. As a result of his association with the campaign, which ran between 1971 and 1990, he received the MBE in 2000. He had a role as Frank Alexander's manservant, Julian, in the film A Clockwork Orange (1971), in which he was noticed by the future Star Wars director George Lucas. He played a circus strongman in Vampire Circus (1972), a Minotaur in the Doctor Who serial The Time Mon",5,1,5,1
33,where did buster posey go to high school?,"Leesburg, GA",Leesburg,"There are a lot of things to enjoy about Florida State University baseball. Part of the fun is watching a number of the young players develop their skills at FSU and then go on to play professional baseball. It is a special treat when they become very successful and make it to baseball's major leagues. Some have even become stars at that lofty level. Such has been the case with former Seminoles Dick Howser, Woody Woodward, Terry Kennedy, Jody Reed, and J.D. Drew, to name but a few. Nowadays, we have another of those special treats in being able to follow the career of Buster Posey. Buster Posey Posey's baseball development is a most interesting and unusual story. In the little town of Leesburg, just north of Albany, Georgia, he was an excellent high school shortstop who also pitched. In 2004, he was a member of the USA Junior Olympic team and started two games as a pitcher at the 2004 IBAF World Championships. He was good enough to be named Georgia's Gatorade Player of the Year in his senior year denoting him as the best Georgia high school player that season according to the award's selection committee. Out of high school he was drafted by the California Angels in 2005 but not until the 50th round. It would be interesting to know who the 49 guys were that the Angels drafted ahead of him. Fortunately for FSU he turned down California's invitation and chose instead to play for the Seminoles. As a shortstop for FSU in his freshman year, he was outstanding. He started all 65 games, was second on the team in hitting with a .346 average and was proclaimed a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American at the end of the season. As FSU prepared for the 2007 season, Assistant Coach Mike Martin, Jr., who had been a catcher for FSU as an undergraduate, saw something in Posey's skills that caused him to ask Posey to try playing catcher. It was a perfect fit. Almost immediately, Posey became one of the best catchers in college baseball. His batting improved to .382 and at the end of the year he was not only on the All ACC team but was a first team All-American by Collegiate Baseball. He also became the first college sophomore ever to be a finalist for the Johnny Bench Catcher's Award. There was no slowing down for Posey in the 2008 season. In his junior year, as team Captain, he batted .463, caught, was the team pitching closer, and led the team to the College World Series. When the dust had settled he had won about every award that can be given to a college player as the 2008 consensus national player of the year. As such he won the Brooks Wallace Award, the Dick Howser Trophy, and the Golden Spikes Award, each of which recognizes a national player of the year as well as the Johnny Bench Award as the Best Catcher. When the baseball draft came this time, he was the San Francisco Giants' first pick (fifth overall). When he eventually signed a contract, he got a $6.2 million bonus, which at the time was the highest bonus ever paid upfront by a major league team. In 2009, Posey's first year as a professional baseball player, he began in Class A Baseball with the San Jose Giants, but soon, in July was promoted to the Triple A Fresno Grizzlies and then in September was called up to the majors when the Giants' regular catcher was injured. Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. In 2010, he started the season back in Triple A with Fresno, but on May 29, 2010, he was back with the Giants' major league team. He started out primarily as a first baseman and backup catcher but when the regular first baseman was traded away in late June, Posey became the starting catcher for the Giants. What happened after that is most remarkable. With Posey leading the way, both at bat where he batted .305 and hit 18 home runs during the regular season, and as the catcher controlling the pitchers the Giants won their division. They went on to win the National League Championship and then became World Champs by defeating the Texas Rangers, four games to one in the World Series. At the end of it all, Posey won a plethora of awards including being named the National League Rookie of the Year. As the sixth Giant in history to win that award he joined the list that includes Willie Mays, Orlando Cepeda, Willie McCovey, Gary Matthews and John Montefusco. As I write this, the major league teams' spring training is in progress. The word I get is that Posey has picked up where he left off and is headed for another good season. I hope that is the case because there are lots of FSU fans that will be watching and cheering for him to do so. It will be a lot of fun following Buster Posey. I hope that it will be a long ride.

34,what is the name of king george vi wife?,"Queen Elizabeth VIII, known as Queen Elizabeth, was the wife of King George VI.",Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,"George VI (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death in 1952. He was also the last Emperor of India from 1936 until the British Raj was dissolved in August 1947, and the first head of the Commonwealth following the London Declaration of 1949. The future George VI was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria; he was named Albert at birth after his great-grandfather Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was known as ""Bertie"" to his family and close friends. His father ascended the throne as George V in 1910. As the second son of the king, Albert was not expected to inherit the throne. He spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Edward, the heir apparent. Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stutter, which he learned to manage to some degree. His elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936, but Edward abdicated later that year to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. As heir presumptive to Edward VIII, Albert became king, taking the regnal name George VI. In September 1939, the British Empire and most Commonwealth countries—but not Ireland—declared war on Nazi Germany, following the invasion of Poland. War with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George VI was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. Britain and its allies were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had largely broken away, followed by the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died at Sandringham House, aged 56, of a coronary thrombosis. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II. == Early life == Albert was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), was the eldest child and only daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been ""rather distressed"". Two days later, he wrote again: ""I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her."" The Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: ""I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good."" Consequently, he was baptised ""Albert Frederick Arthur George"" at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham on 17 February 1896. Formally he was His Highness Prince Albert of York; within the royal family he was known informally a

George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 – 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until his death in 1820. The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with George as its king. He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was a monarch of the House of Hanover, who, unlike his two predecessors, was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover. George was born during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King George II, as the first son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Following his father's death in 1751, Prince George became heir apparent and Prince of Wales. He succeeded to the throne on George II's death in 1760. The following year, he married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, with whom he had 15 children. George III's life and reign were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, Britain lost 13 of its North American colonies in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. In 1807, the transatlantic slave trade was banned from the British Empire. In the later part of his life, George had recurrent and eventually permanent mental illness. The exact nature of the mental illness is not known definitively, but historians and medical experts have suggested that his symptoms and behaviour traits were consistent with either bipolar disorder or porphyria. In 1810, George suffered a final relapse, and his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, was named Prince Regent the following year. The King died aged 81, at which time the Regent succeeded him as George IV. George III reigned during much of the Georgian and Regency eras. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch, having reigned for 59 years and 96 days; he remains the longest-lived and longest-reigning male monarch in British history. == Early life == George was born in Norfolk House in St James's Square, London, on 4 June 1738. He was a grandson of King George II and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. As he was born two months prematurely, and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's Church, Piccadilly, and Bishop of Oxford. One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were King Frederick I of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy), and his great-aunt Sophia Dorothea, Queen in Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy). George grew into a healthy, reserved and shy child. The family moved to Leicester Square, where George and his younger brother Edward (later Duke of York and Albany) were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight. He was the first British monarch to study science systematically. Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing and riding. His religious education was wholly Anglican. At the age of 10, George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison's play Cato and said in the

Leopold II (9 April 1835 – 17 December 1909) was the second King of the Belgians from 1865 to 1909, and the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908. Born in Brussels as the second but eldest-surviving son of King Leopold I and Queen Louise, Leopold succeeded his father to the Belgian throne in 1865 and reigned for 44 years until his death, the longest reign of a Belgian monarch to date. He died without surviving legitimate sons; the current King of the Belgians, Philippe, descends from his nephew and successor, Albert I. He is popularly referred to as the Builder King (Dutch: Koning-Bouwheer, French: Roi-Bâtisseur) in Belgium in reference to the great number of buildings, urban projects and public works he commissioned. Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private colonial project undertaken on his own behalf as a personal union with Belgium. He used Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe authorised his claim and committed the Congo Free State to him. Leopold ran the Congo, which he never personally visited, by using the mercenary Force Publique for his personal gain. He extracted a fortune from the territory, initially by the collection of ivory and, after a rise in the price of natural rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the native population to harvest and process rubber. Leopold's administration was characterized by systematic brutality and atrocities in the Congo Free State, including forced labour, torture, murder, kidnapping, and the amputation of the hands of men, women, and children when the quota of rubber was not met. In one of the first uses of the term, George Washington Williams described the practices of Leopold's administration of the Congo Free State as ""crimes against humanity"" in 1890. While it has proven difficult to accurately estimate the pre-colonial population and the amount by which it changed under the Congo Free State, estimates for the Congolese population decline during Leopold's rule range from 1 million to 15 million. The causes of the decline included epidemic disease, a reduced birth rate, and violence and famine caused by the regime.: 225–233 == Early life == Leopold was born in Brussels on 9 April 1835, the second child of the reigning Belgian monarch, Leopold I, and of his second wife, Louise, the daughter of King Louis Philippe of France. His eldest brother, Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium, died in infancy in 1834. As heir apparent, Leopold was granted the title of Duke of Brabant in 1840. The French Revolution of 1848 forced his maternal grandfather, Louis Philippe, to flee to the United Kingdom. Louis Philippe died two years later, in 1850. Leopold's fragile mother was deeply affected by the death of her father and her health deteriorated. She died of tuberculosis that same year, when Leopold was 15 years old. Leopold's sister Charlotte became Empress Carlota of Mexico in the 1860s. The British monarch at the time, Queen Victoria, was Leopold II's first cousin, as was Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, since Leopold's father, Albert's father, Duke Ernest I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and Victoria's mother, the then Duchess of Kent, were all siblings. As a young man, Leopold II served in the Belgian military and achieved the rank of lieutenant-general. He also served in the Belgian Senate during this time. == Marriage and family == At the age of 18, Leopold married Marie Henriette of Austria, a cousin of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and granddaughter of the late Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, on 22 August 1853 in Brussels. Lively and energetic, Marie Henriette endeared herself to the people by her character and benevolence. Her beauty earned her the sobriquet ""The Rose of Brabant"". She was also an accomplished artist and musician. She was passionate about horseback riding, to the",1,1,5,1
35,where does kurdish people live?,"Kurdish people primarily live in a region known as Kurdistan, which spans parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran.",Asia,"Who are the Kurds? Between 25 and 35 million Kurds inhabit a mountainous region straddling the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. They make up the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation state. Where do they come from? The Kurds are one of the indigenous peoples of the Mesopotamian plains and the highlands in what are now south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Syria, northern Iraq, north-western Iran and south-western Armenia. Today, they form a distinctive community, united through race, culture and language, even though they have no standard dialect. They also adhere to a number of different religions and creeds, although the majority are Sunni Muslims. Why don't they have a state? Despite their long history, the Kurds have never achieved a permanent nation state In the early 20th Century, many Kurds began to consider the creation of a homeland - generally referred to as ""Kurdistan"". After World War One and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Western allies made provision for a Kurdish state in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres. Such hopes were dashed three years later, however, when the Treaty of Lausanne, which set the boundaries of modern Turkey, made no provision for a Kurdish state and left Kurds with minority status in their respective countries. Over the next 80 years, any move by Kurds to set up an independent state was brutally quashed. Why were Kurds at the forefront of the fight against IS? Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been fighting IS militants in northern Iraq In mid-2013, the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) turned its sights on three Kurdish enclaves that bordered territory under its control in northern Syria. It launched repeated attacks that until mid-2014 were repelled by the People's Protection Units (YPG) - the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). An IS advance in northern Iraq in June 2014 also drew that country's Kurds into the conflict. The government of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan Region sent its Peshmerga forces to areas abandoned by the Iraqi army. In August 2014, the jihadists launched a surprise offensive and the Peshmerga withdrew from several areas. A number of towns inhabited by religious minorities fell, notably Sinjar, where IS militants killed or captured thousands of Yazidis. Image source, AFP Image caption, Turkish military personnel did not intervene in the battle for Kobane In response, a US-led multinational coalition launched air strikes in northern Iraq and sent military advisers to help the Peshmerga. The YPG and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades and has bases in Iraq, also came to their aid. In September 2014, IS launched an assault on the enclave around the northern Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee across the nearby Turkish border. Despite the proximity of the fighting, Turkey refused to attack IS positions or allow Turkish Kurds to cross to defend it. Image source, AFP Image caption, Kurds accused Turkish authorities of complicity after a 2015 suicide bombing in Suruc In January 2015, after a battle that left at least 1,600 people dead, Kurdish forces regained control of Kobane. The Kurds - fighting alongside several local Arab militias under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance, and helped by US-led coalition air strikes, weapons and advisers - then steadily drove IS out of tens of thousands of square kilometres of territory in north-eastern Syria and established control over a large stretch of the border with Turkey. In October 2017, SDF fighters captured the de facto IS capital of Raqqa and then advanced south-eastwards into the neighbouring province of Deir al-Zour - the jihadists' last major foothold in Syria. Image source, AFP Image caption, The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance captured the IS stronghold of Raqqa The last pocket of territory held by IS in Syria - around the village of Baghouz - fell to the SDF in March 2019. The SDF hailed the ""total elimination"" of the IS ""caliphate"", but it warned that jihadist sleeper cells remained ""a great threat"". The SDF was also left to deal with the thousands of suspected IS militants captured during the last two years of the battle, as well as tens of thousands of displaced women and children associated with IS fighters. The US called for the repatriation of foreign nationals among them, but most of their home countries refused. Image source, AFP Image caption, The SDF is holding 70,000 civilians who fled areas once held by IS In October 2019, US troops pulled back from the border with Turkey after the country's president said it was about to launch an operation to set up a 32km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" clear of YPG fighters and resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees there. The SDF said it had been ""stabbed in the back"" by the US and warned that the offensive might reverse the defeat of IS, the fight against which it said it could no longer prioritise. Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels made steady gains in the first few days of the operation. In response, the SDF turned to the Syrian government for help and reached a deal for the Syrian army to deploy along the border. Why does Turkey see Kurds as a threat? There is deep-seated hostility between the Turkish state and the country's Kurds, who constitute 15% to 20% of the population. Kurds received harsh treatment at the hands of the Turkish authorities for generations. In response to uprisings in the 1920s and 1930s, many Kurds were resettled, Kurdish names and costumes were banned, the use of the Kurdish language was restricted, and even the existence of a Kurdish ethnic identity was denied, with people designated ""Mountain Turks"". In 1978, Abdullah Ocalan established the PKK, which called for an independent state within Turkey. Six years later, the group began an armed struggle. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. Image source, AFP Image caption, More than 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched an armed struggle in 1984 In the 1990s the PKK rolled back on its demand for independence, calling instead for greater cultural and political autonomy, but continued to fight. In 2013, a ceasefire was agreed after secret talks were held. The ceasefire collapsed in July 2015, after a suicide bombing blamed on IS killed 33 young activists in the mainly Kurdish town of Suruc, near the Syrian border. The PKK accused the authorities of complicity and attacked Turkish soldiers and police. The Turkish government subsequently launched what it called a ""synchronised war on terror"" against the PKK and IS. Since then, several thousand people - including hundreds of civilians - have been killed in clashes in south-eastern Turkey. Image source, AFP Image caption, The city of Cizre was devastated by fighting between Turkish forces and the PKK Turkey has maintained a military presence in northern Syria since August 2016, when it sent troops and tanks over the border to support a Syrian rebel offensive against IS. Those forces captured the key border town of Jarablus, preventing the YPG-led SDF from seizing the territory itself and linking up with the Kurdish enclave of Afrin to the west. In 2018, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels launched an operation to expel YPG fighters from Afrin. Dozens of civilians were killed and tens of thousands displaced. Turkey's government says the YPG and the PYD are extensions of the PKK, share its goal of secession through armed struggle, and are terrorist organisations that must be eliminated. What do Syria's Kurds want? The Democratic Union Party (PYD) is the dominant force in Syria's Kurdish regions Kurds make up between 7% and 10% of Syria's population. Before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011 most lived in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, and in three, non-contiguous areas around Kobane, Afrin, and the north-eastern city of Qamishli. Syria's Kurds have long been suppressed and denied basic rights. Some 300,000 have been denied citizenship since the 1960s, and Kurdish land has been confiscated and redistributed to Arabs in an attempt to ""Arabize"" Kurdish regions. When the uprising evolved into a civil war, the main Kurdish parties publicly avoided taking sides. In mid-2012, government forces withdrew to concentrate on fighting the rebels elsewhere, and Kurdish groups took control in their wake. Image source, AFP Image caption, The YPG has emerged as a key ally of the US-led coalition battle against IS In January 2014, Kurdish parties - including the dominant Democratic Union Party (PYD) - declared the creation of ""autonomous administrations"" in the three ""cantons"" of Afrin, Kobane and Jazira. In March 2016, they announced the establishment of a ""federal system"" that included mainly Arab and Turkmen areas captured from IS. The declaration was rejected by the Syrian government, the Syrian opposition, Turkey and the US. Image source, AFP Image caption, The creation of a federal system in Kurdish-controlled northern Syria was announced in 2016 The PYD says it is not seeking independence, but insists that any political settlement to end the conflict in Syria must include legal guarantees for Kurdish rights and recognition of Kurdish autonomy.

His government has also rejected Kurdish demands for autonomy, saying that ""nobody in Syria accepts talk about independent entities or federalism"". Will Iraq's Kurds gain independence? Image source, Hulton Archive Image caption, A peace deal agreed by the KDP and Iraq's government in 1970 collapsed four years later Kurds make up an estimated 15% to 20% of Iraq's population. They have historically enjoyed more national rights than Kurds living in neighbouring states, but also faced brutal repression. In 1946, Mustafa Barzani formed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to fight for autonomy in Iraq. But it was not until 1961 that he launched a full armed struggle. Image source, AFP Image caption, Some 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds fled into Iran and Turkey after the 1991 rebellion was crushed In the late 1970s, the government began settling Arabs in areas with Kurdish majorities, particularly around the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, and forcibly relocating Kurds. The policy was accelerated in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq War, in which the Kurds backed the Islamic republic. In 1988, Saddam Hussein unleashed a campaign of vengeance on the Kurds that included the chemical attack on Halabja. When Iraq was defeated in the 1991 Gulf War, Barzani's son Massoud and Jalal Talabani of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led a Kurdish rebellion. Its violent suppression prompted the US and its allies to impose a no-fly zone in the north that allowed Kurds to enjoy self-rule. The KDP and PUK agreed to share power, but tensions rose and a four-year war erupted between them in 1994. Image source, AFP Image caption, Massoud Barzani's KDP and Jalal Talabani's PUK shared power after the fall of Saddam The parties co-operated with the US-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam and governed in coalition in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), created two years later to administer Dohuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya provinces. Massoud Barzani was appointed the region's president, while Jalal Talabani became Iraq's first non-Arab head of state. In September 2017, a referendum on independence was held in both the Kurdistan Region and the disputed areas seized by the Peshmerga in 2014, including Kirkuk. The vote was opposed by the Iraqi central government, which insisted it was illegal. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, People in Kurdish-held areas decisively backed independence in a September 2017 referendum More than 90% of the 3.3 million people who voted supported secession. KRG officials said the result gave them a mandate to start negotiations with Baghdad, but then Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi demanded that it be annulled. The following month Iraqi pro-government forces retook the disputed territory held by the Kurds. The loss of Kirkuk and its oil revenue was a major blow to Kurdish aspirations for their own state. After his gamble backfired, Mr Barzani stepped down as the Kurdistan Region's president. But disagreements between the main parties meant the post remained vacant until June 2019, when he was succeeded by his nephew Nechirvan.

Kurdish culture is a group of distinctive cultural traits practiced by Kurdish people. The Kurdish culture is a legacy from ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society. Kurds are an ethnic group who live in the northern Middle East, in a region that the Kurds call Greater Kurdistan. Greater Kurdistan lies along the Zagros Mountains and the Taurus Mountains, and today comprises northeastern Iraq, northwestern Iran, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey. == Miscellaneous == There is a lot of controversy about the Kurdish people from their origins, their history, and even their political future. Kurds are one of the largest ethnic groups that do not have an independent state recognized universally. == Language == Kurdish (Kurdî) is part of the North-Western division of the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. == Folklore == The Kurds have a rich folkloric tradition which is increasingly endangered as a result of modernization, urbanization, and cultural repression. Kurds celebrate the new year on Newroz, and its celebration was often banned by authorities in Turkey and Syria. A well known Kurdish tale is Mem û Zîn. === Zembilfrosh === Zembilfrosh (Kurdish: زەمبیلفرۆش) (Kurdish for ""basket seller"") is a folktale popular in Turkish Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan. Zembilfrosh was the son of a powerful Kurdish ruler who left his home and life behind to seek a spiritual life as a dervish. He wanders the countryside with his faithful wife, surviving by making and selling baskets. One day they arrive in the capital of a Kurdish emirate, where the prince's wife sees Zembilfrosh and falls in love with him. She summons him to the castle, where she declares her love for him and tries to seduce him. Zembilfrosh declines, but she presses, promising him many riches. Zembilfrosh is not persuaded and she locks him in a castle tower, from which he eventually escapes. The prince's wife then disguises herself and starts searching for Zembilfrosh, and eventually finds him. She then deceives Zembilfrosh's wife, convincing her to lend her her clothes and leave the house. When Zembilfrosh returns that night, it is dark and he does not recognize the prince's wife, who welcomes him into bed. However, a silver anklet gives her away, and he runs off, chased after by his would-be-lover. As Zembilfrosh sees that escape is impossible, he prays to God, supplicating to be released from a world of misery, and God complies. Reaching Zembilfrosh's lifeless body, the prince's wife is so heartbroken that she dies as well. They are then buried side by side. Their resting place is claimed to be located at the contemporary town of Batifa, a subdistrict of the district of Zakho, Duhok governorate, in Iraqi Kurdistan. == Music == Kurdish folk music is an important part of Kurdish culture and has traditionally been used to transmit stories about Kurdish history by Dengbêj. Dengbêj (bards, literally ""voice-sing"") are well known for songs of mourning, or stran. Many popular Kurdish musicians of the 20th century like Hassan Zirak and Ahmet Kaya sang in Turkish or Persian as well as in Kurdish. == Cinema == Kurdish cinema focuses on the Kurdish people and culture. The fate of the Kurds as a people without a state shaped their cinema. Kurdish films often show social grievances, oppression, torture, human rights violations, and life as a stranger. Kurdish cinema has a high significance for the Kurds, as it offers the opportunity to draw attention to their own situation artistically. However, because of state repression, most films are produced in exile. The best example of this is in Turkey, where Kurds were not permitted to speak their native language until 1991, which made the development of their films more difficult. Films about Kurds: Zare (Hamo Beknazarian, 1926) The Herd (Yilmaz Güney, 1978) Yol (Yılmaz Güney, 1982) A Time for Drunken Horses (Bahman Ghobadi, 2000) Turtles Can Fly?

Together, they compose the national bicameral legislature of the United States. The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation, known as bills; those that are also passed by the Senate are sent to the president for signature or veto. The House's exclusive powers include initiating all revenue bills, impeaching federal officers, and electing the president if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Members of the House serve a fixed term of two years, with each seat up for election before the start of the next Congress. Special elections also occur when a seat is vacated early enough. The House's composition was established by Article One of the United States Constitution. The House is composed of representatives who, pursuant to the Uniform Congressional District Act, sit in single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population as measured by the United States census, with each district having at least a single representative, provided that that state is entitled to them. Since its inception in 1789, all representatives have been directly elected. Although suffrage was initially limited, it gradually widened, particularly after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment and the civil rights movement. Since 1913, the number of voting representatives has been at 435 pursuant to the Apportionment Act of 1911. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 capped the size of the House at 435. However, the number was temporarily increased from 1959 until 1963 to 437 following the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii to the Union. In addition, five non-voting delegates represent the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. A non-voting resident commissioner, serving a four-year term, represents the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. As of the 2020 census, the largest delegation was California, with 52 representatives. Six states have only one representative apiece: Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol. The rules of the House generally address a two-party system, with a majority party in government, and a minority party in opposition. The presiding officer is the speaker of the House, who is elected by the members thereof. Other floor leaders are chosen by the Democratic Caucus or the Republican Conference, depending on whichever party has the most voting members. == History == Under the Articles of Confederation, the Congress of the Confederation was a unicameral body with equal representation for each state, any of which could veto most actions. After eight years of a more limited confederal government under the Articles, numerous political leaders such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton initiated the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which received the Confederation Congress's sanction to ""amend the Articles of Confederation"". All states except Rhode Island agreed to send delegates. Congress's structure was a contentious issue among the founders during the convention. Edmund Randolph's Virginia Plan called for a bicameral Congress: the lower house would be ""of the people"", elected directly by the people of the United States and representing public opinion, and a more deliberative upper house, elected by the lower house, that would represent the individual states, and would be less susceptible to variations of mass sentiment. The House is commonly referred to as the lower house and the Senate the upper house, although the United States Constitution does not use that terminology. Both houses' approval is necessary for the passage of legislation. The Virginia Plan drew the support of delegates from large states such as Virginia, Massachuset

Contents Article The youth of George Washington (1732-1799), the first President of the United States, remains the least understood chapter of his life, shrouded in folklore and myths. Yet the experiences of his youth, and the bond he felt toward his older half-brother Lawrence, shaped the man he was to become and helped put him on the path toward revolution and the presidency. Young George Washington with His Father John C. McRae after G. G. White (Public Domain) This article examines what is known about the lineage and youth of George Washington, from the first time his great-grandfather set foot on the shores of Virginia in 1657 until George's own coming of age in 1753, a year before the shots fired at the Battle of Fort Necessity changed the trajectory of his own life and, it can be argued, of world history. Tall, strong, and somewhat physically awkward, the young George Washington grew up on a plantation just outside of Fredericksburg, Virginia, and moved to Mount Vernon as his brother's ward shortly after the death of their father. He became a land surveyor at the age of 16, measuring over 60,000 acres of land along the unmapped western frontier of Virginia. When Lawrence contracted a fatal case of tuberculosis, George accompanied him to Barbados, the only time he ever left the boundaries of the future United States; while there, he had a short but painful bout with smallpox, and for the first time came face to face with the military might of Great Britain. He had experienced much by his 21st birthday in 1753, although nothing could have prepared him for what was still to come. Family & Parentage The story of the Washington family in Virginia begins with a shipwreck. On 28 February 1657, the merchant vessel Seahorse of London ran aground on the shoals of the Potomac River during a storm; laden with precious tobacco, the ship had just embarked on its return voyage to England. Among its crew was a young Englishman named John Washington (b. 1633), who had taken to a life at sea after his father, an Anglican rector, had had his properties confiscated for his support of the Royalists during the English Civil Wars (1642-1651). As the crewmen went to work repairing the Seahorse of London, John Washington befriended several locals including Anne Pope, the daughter of a wealthy Maryland planter. It was perhaps out of love for Anne - or perhaps because he spied more opportunity in America than on the open seas - that induced John to stay behind after the crewmen sailed the repaired vessel back to England. John Washington married Anne Pope in late 1658, with the marriage ultimately producing five children. Upon his 21st birthday, Augustine Washington inherited 1,000 acres of land as well as six enslaved people. Before his death in August 1677, John Washington made quite an impression on his adoptive home of Virginia. He had purchased or inherited upwards of 5,000 acres of land, upon which tobacco was planted and harvested by both enslaved Africans and white indentured servants. John's eldest son, Lawrence (b. 1659) was therefore left with a decent inheritance and was perfectly poised to enter public service. Before the age of 25, he served as both the Justice of the Peace and in the House of Burgesses, cementing the place of the Washington family among the colony's landed gentry. Around 1686, he married Mildred Warner, the daughter of the Speaker of the House of Burgesses, with whom he would have three children: John (1692-1746), Augustine (1694-1743), and Mildred (1698-1747). Lawrence died an early death in 1698, after which his widow remarried to an English merchant, George Gale, and moved her children to Whitehaven, England, before she died in 1701. Gale took care of the orphaned Washington children, enrolling the boys in the nearby grammar school at Appleby. Augustine Washington, the middle child of Lawrence and Mildred, returned to Virginia sometime before he came of age in 1715 to claim his inheritance. Called 'Gus' by family and friends, he was tall, blond, and muscular, and was said to have been as gentle as he was strong. Upon his 21st birthday, he inherited 1,000 acres of land as well as six enslaved people; his marriage to Jane Butler that same year added another 1,700 acres to his already considerable amount of property. The couple settled on Gus' main plot of land at Pope's Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia, where construction soon began on a home called Wakefield. It was here that Jane gave birth to three surviving children: Lawrence (1718-1752), Augustine, Jr. (1720-1762), and Jane (1722-1735). Like his own father, Augustine entered public life, serving as Justice of the Peace and sheriff for Westmoreland County. He also continued buying up properties, including a tract of land near Accokeek Creek, 8 miles (13 km) northeast of Fredericksburg. It was on this land that rich deposits of iron were discovered in the late 1720s; looking to capitalize on this, Augustine began negotiating with the Principio Company, an association of British ironmasters and merchants, to construct an ironworks on the land. In 1729, Augustine went to England to finalize negotiations with his new business partners only to discover upon his return that his wife Jane had died. Distraught though he was, it was not customary for Virginian widowers to stay single for long, and, on 6 March 1731, Augustine Washington was remarried to 23-year-old Mary Ball. Childhood & Education Mary Ball Washington gave birth to her firstborn son at Wakefield at 10 a.m. on 22 February 1732. His name was George. His birth would be followed by five younger siblings: Elizabeth (1733-1797), Samuel (1734-1781), John Augustine (1736-1787), Charles (1738-1799), and Mildred (1739-1740). In 1734, Augustine moved his rapidly growing family 60 miles (96 km) up the Potomac River to the Little Hunting Creek plantation, where he could keep a closer eye on his lucrative ironworks. He ordered the construction of a house on this property that would form the basis for Mount Vernon. Before long, Augustine moved the family once again, this time to the Ferry Farm estate near Fredericksburg, Virginia; it was here where George Washington spent much of his youth. The supposed instance in which George Washington was unable to lie to his father about chopping down a prized cherry tree was later fabricated. Not much is known about George's childhood; indeed, in terms of historical scholarship, it remains the murkiest chapter of his life. He was certainly raised on the Ferry Farm plantation, and likely attended a local school in Fredericksburg, where he excelled in the subjects of geometry, trigonometry, and mapmaking. Some of his school papers survive, in which he copied out sets of moral teachings from the book Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation; these 'rules', which included such counsel as ""in the presence of others, sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet"", showed George how to be a proper Virginian gentleman, guidance he would follow for the rest of his life. Folkloric stories about George's childhood - such as the supposed instance in which he was unable to lie to his father about chopping down a prized cherry tree - were later fabricated, to fill in the gaps in this unknown part of his life. In 1743, Augustine Washington unexpectedly died. At only 11 years old, George inherited Ferry Farm as well as ten enslaved people. Too young to fend for himself, he was sent to live with his eldest half-brother, Lawrence, who had inherited the Little Hunting Creek estate and had renamed it Mount Vernon, in honor of British Admiral Edward Vernon, his commanding officer in the War of Jenkins' Ear. George idolized and adored Lawrence and soon tried to emulate the ""grace, bearing, and manners"" of his refined older brother (Freeman, 5). Eventually, George would come to regard Lawrence as both a father figure and a best friend. Lawrence Washington seemed to be a good role model for the young George as he was quickly making a name for himself in Virginia. In 1744, he was elected to the House of Burgesses and, a few years later, helped found the Ohio Company, a land speculation company that was chartered to settle the uncolonized lands of the Ohio River Valley. Lawrence also married Anne Fairfax, the daughter of his influential neighbor Thomas Fairfax, whose patronage would soon affect George's life. Surveying Career After finishing his education, George's proficiency in mathematics led him to consider a career in land surveying, which at the time was considered a respectable path to wealth and social advancement. In 1748, at the age of 16, George Washington set out on an expedition into the wilderness of the Shenandoah Valley to survey the properties of Lawrence's father-in-law Thomas Fairfax. It was to be the first time George set foot off the lands where he had grown up on the Virginia Neck, and he kept a diary to recount his experiences on this, his first real adventure. Led by Thomas' son, George William Fairfax, the surveying party proceeded along the bank of the Potomac River, setting out on 14 March 1748; that night, after a long day of journeying, George was disappointed to find there was nothing to sleep on except a ""thread bare blanket with double its weight of vermin such as lice fleas"". Then, on 22 March, George encountered Native Americans for the first time, their party carrying a scalp. George recorded in his journal how one of the natives constructed a drum by stretching deerskin over a half-filled pot of water, while the others danced around a roaring fire. George Washington as a Land Surveyor Henry Hintermeister (Public Domain) This first expedition was, ultimately, a success, and George received his land surveyor's license the following year. Impressed with the young man's abilities, Thomas Fairfax used his influence to get George appointed as a land surveyor for the newly formed Culpeper County, on Virginia's western frontier. Over the course of the next three years, George Washington conducted 200 surveys, measuring a combined total of 60,000 acres of land. These surveying trips took him far beyond the limits of Culpeper County, and he was soon venturing into the Blue Ridge Mountains and other unsettled territories in the west. This experience would give him a lifelong interest in the western lands, an interest that influenced the choices that led to him taking up arms in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolution. He stopped surveying land professionally in 1752 but would continue to do so for his own properties for the rest of his life. Trip to Barbados In the spring of 1749, as George's land surveying career was taking off, Lawrence came down with a heavy cough. At first, he tried to ignore it and carry on with his duties, but the cough would not go away and became so bad that he had to take a leave of absence from the House of Burgesses in May. By early 1751, it was clear that the oldest Washington brother was suffering from tuberculosis (commonly known as 'consumption' in those days), prompting him to seek a more tropical climate in the hopes that the balmy air might restore his health. Barbados, a small island in the southeastern Caribbean, was known to be a popular destination for tuberculosis patients, leading Lawrence to select it as his destination. His wife Anne was unable to accompany him - she had an infant daughter to look after whose health she did not want to risk on a long voyage - so 19-year-old George agreed to go instead. The brothers' vessel set sail from the Potomac on 28 September 1751, arriving on the east coast of Barbados at 4 a.m. on 2 November. Britain's military might in Barbados fascinated Washington & may have convinced him to pursue a military career. The brothers disembarked and went to Bridgetown, the island's main settlement, and eventually found lodgings at the home of Captain Crofton, overlooking Carlisle Bay. As Lawrence consulted with his physicians, George marveled at the tropical landscape of Barbados, which was unlike anything he had ever seen, and found that he was 'perfectly ravished' by the island's beauty (mountvernon.org). He and Lawrence often dined at the homes of important Barbados officials, one of whom offered George a tour of Charles Fort on Needham Point. The 36-gun fort, which guarded the entrance to Carlisle Bay, was the first such fortress George had ever seen, and had a significant impact on the young Virginian; whereas previously he had given little thought to military matters, his glimpse of Britain's military might in Barbados fascinated him and may have convinced him to pursue a military career of his own once he returned to Virginia. On 17 November, amidst the intoxicating rush of social life in Bridgetown, George came down with a fever. By the evening, he was complaining of a severe headache and pains in his back and sides, and small red dots appeared on his forehead three days later. George had contracted smallpox, one of the most feared diseases of his time - while it was much rarer in Virginia, it was common in the Caribbean. For several days, George was confined to bed, fighting his painful battle with the pox. But he was young and healthy and recovered soon enough, although his face was marred with the telltale scars that denoted a smallpox survivor. George would never forget his bout of smallpox, nor how close to death he had come. During the American Revolution, when a smallpox outbreak was ravaging the colonies, he would mandate that all his soldiers be inoculated against the disease, an act that several historians credit with having saved the Continental Army from destruction. Death of Lawrence On 21 December, shortly after his recovery, George sailed for Virginia alone; Lawrence, whose condition had not much improved, decided to try Bermuda instead but urged his younger brother to return home. George arrived at Yorktown on 28 January 1752 and immediately went on to Williamsburg to pay his respects to the governor, Robert Dinwiddie, who would soon play an important role in his life. He then returned to Mount Vernon and fell hopelessly in love with Elizabeth 'Betsy' Fauntleroy, daughter of a respected family. This was far from the first time George had been in love; as a teenager, he had written poetry about girls he had crushes on, but he had never formally courted any of them. Now that he was of a marriageable age, he made two romantic overtures to Betsy Fauntleroy but was rejected each time. It would be another seven years before he would marry the widowed Martha Dandridge Custis, his future First Lady. Lawrence Washington possibly Gustavus Hesselius (Public Domain) Sometime in early June 1752, Lawrence returned from Bermuda, but not because he had recovered; having realized he was dying, he had decided to ""hurry home to [his] grave"" so that he might put his affairs in order and die in the land on which he had been born (Freeman, 31). Lawrence completed and signed his will on 20 June and died six days later at the age of 34; the grief-stricken George was entrusted with putting together the funeral arrangements and building a burial vault for his beloved half-brother. The ownership of Mount Vernon passed to Lawrence's widow, Anne, but because she did not live there, she agreed to lease the property to George; upon Anne's own death in 1761, George became the official owners of Mount Vernon (Lawrence and Anne's only daughter, Sarah, had died in infancy in 1754). Conclusion: Washington the Soldier In 1753, George Washington turned 21, considered the age of maturity in Colonial America. Like his father, he was physically strong and stood over 6 feet tall (183 cm) in his stockings, towering over most of his contemporaries. He had grey-blue eyes and reddish hair that he powdered and curled in the fashion of the time. He was known to be a graceful dancer, a skilled horseback rider, and fond of hunting, traits that marked him out as a proper Virginian gentleman. Yet like other young gentlemen of that time, George Washington thirsted for adventure; the awe-inspiring sight of Charles Fort in Barbados had led him to dream of martial glory, much like his idolized brother Lawrence had achieved at the Siege of Cartagena during his service in the War of Jenkins' Ear.

In 1753, word reached Virginia that the French had begun to build forts in the Ohio River Valley, on lands that had been claimed by the Ohio Company, which had been partially founded by Lawrence Washington. Governor Dinwiddie, who was an investor in the Ohio Company, dispatched George to demand that the French leave the territory at once. George Washington's decision to accept the mission, although undoubtedly fueled by his lust for glory, was also made from the experiences of his youth. He was compelled to defend the claims of the Ohio Company both out of love and loyalty to his older brother and because of his own experiences as a surveyor of western lands, lands he believed rightfully belonged to Virginians. Whatever his reasons, Washington's journey into the West in 1753 would change the trajectory of his life, putting him on the path to becoming a soldier and, ultimately, president of a nation he would help forge, the United States of America.

The 2025 speaker of the United States House of Representatives election took place on January 3, 2025, on the opening day of the 119th United States Congress, two months after the 2024 elections for the United States House of Representatives. This was the 130th speaker of the House of Representatives election since the office was created in 1789. The incumbent speaker, Republican Mike Johnson of Louisiana, was re-elected on the first ballot, defeating Hakeem Jeffries with a slim 218–215 majority. Johnson, who had replaced Kevin McCarthy in October 2023 after McCarthy was removed from the position, was initially expected to lose on the first ballot, as several Republican congressmen had told major news outlets they had no intention to vote for him. Ultimately, on the opening day of the 119th Congress, three Republicans—Thomas Massie, Ralph Norman, and Keith Self—voted against Johnson, while all Democrats voted for Jeffries, thus, Johnson had initially fallen short of the 218 vote majority. However, shortly before the vote was finalized by House clerk Kevin McCumber, Norman and Self switched their votes to Johnson, which gave him the majority to secure the speakership. == Process and conventions == The speaker is the presiding officer of the U.S. House of Representatives. The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress (i.e. biennially, after Election Day) or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position intra-term. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. Following a congressional election and the adjournment of the prior congress, there being no speaker, the House clerk summons, convenes, and calls the House to order. After prayer offered by the House chaplain, the clerk leads the representatives in the Pledge of Allegiance before ordering a roll call conducted by the reading clerk. The clerk and its officers then order and oversee the election of a speaker. During these processes, the clerk must ""preserve order and decorum and decide all questions of order"", which is subject to appeal to the body. Traditionally, each of the party caucuses and conferences selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. Representatives are not restricted to voting for the candidate nominated by their party but generally do, as the outcome of the election effectively determines which one is the majority party and consequently will organize the House. Without a speaker, members-elect of the House cannot be sworn in. The House is unable to conduct any business other than electing the speaker. Because the rules of the House are adopted for each new Congress, the House will not have rules until the election is complete allowing the members to be sworn in and the House to adopt rules. Representatives that choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominated candidate usually vote for another member within the party or vote present, which entails abstention. Moreover, as the Constitution does not explicitly state that the speaker must be an incumbent member of the House, it is permissible for representatives to nominate and vote for someone who is not a member of the House at the time, and non-members have been nominated and received a few votes in various speaker elections over the past several years. Nevertheless, every person elected speaker has been a member. Upon winning election, the new speaker is immediately sworn in by the House dean, the chamber's longest-serving member. The new speaker then administers the oath en masse to the rest of the members of the House. To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes cast, as opposed to a majority of the entire membership of the House. There have only been a few instances during the past century where a person received a majority of the votes cast and thus won the election while failing to obtain a majority of the full membership. This occurred most recently in 2023 when",1,1,1,1
37,who owns the portland press herald?,"Blethen Maine Newspapers, an independent division of The Seattle Times Company.","Blethen Maine Newspapers, Inc.","The Portland Press Herald (abbreviated as PPH; Sunday edition Maine Sunday Telegram) is a daily newspaper based in South Portland, Maine, with a statewide readership. The Press Herald mainly serves southern Maine and is focused on the greater metropolitan area of Portland. Founded in 1862, its roots extend to Maine’s earliest newspapers, the Falmouth Gazette & Weekly Advertiser, started in 1785, and the Eastern Argus, first published in Portland in 1803. For most of the 20th century, it was the cornerstone of Guy Gannett Communications, before being sold to The Seattle Times Company in 1998. Since 2023, it has been a part of the Maine Trust for Local News, a nonprofit group run by the National Trust for Local News that includes four other daily newspapers and 17 weekly newspapers. == History == === 19th century origins === The Portland Daily Press was founded in June 1862 by J. T. Gilman, Joseph B. Hall, and Newell A. Foster as a new Republican paper. Its first issue, published on June 23, 1862, announced strong support for Abraham Lincoln and condemned slavery as ""the foulest blot upon our national character."" Its offices, along with the offices of all the newspapers in the city, were destroyed on July 4, 1866, in Portland's Great Fire. On the morning of July 6, the Portland Daily Press published a double-sided handbill about the fire. The paper quickly gained the largest circulation in Portland, and was one of five daily newspapers in the city to survive to the 20th century. In 1904, the paper was bought by a syndicate of Maine Republicans, including Henry B. Cleaves and gubernatorial candidate Joseph Homan Manley, who the paper had previously opposed. === Guy Gannett ownership === In 1921, the Portland Daily Press was merged with the Portland Herald to form the Portland Press Herald in a sale of the Press from then U.S. Senator Frederick Hale to Guy P. Gannett, who had bought the Herald earlier the same year. The first edition of the Portland Press Herald was published in November 21, 1921. The Press Herald's circulation skyrocketed in the first year of Gannett's ownership, when the paper sold for two cents; circulation went from a little over 18,000 to nearly 29,000. Under Gannett's ownership, the traditionally pro-Republican newspaper adopted a balanced editorial approach; during the 1922 gubernatorial campaign, the newspaper published Democratic candidate William Robinson Pattangall's criticism of the Republican incumbent, Governor Percival Baxter. In a letter to readers, Gannett wrote, ""The American people think for themselves. They want and should be given the news and all the news fully and uncolored by any personal or political consideration."" In the 1920s, Gannett's media empire in Maine grew: he purchased the Portland Evening Express and Daily Advertiser in 1925 (whose name he shortened to Evening Express) and by 1929 also bought Augusta's Kennebec Journal and Waterville's Central Maine Morning Sentinel. In 1923, Gannett built a new building to house all of the paper's operations on 390 Congress Street across from Portland City Hall. In 1928 the Portland Press Herald merged with the Portland Sunday Telegram to form the Portland Sunday Telegram and Sunday Press Herald . === Blethen Maine Newspapers === In 1998, the family trust that ran what was by now Guy Gannett Communications decided to break up its media interests. Ultimately, it decided to sell the Press Herald to The Seattle Times Company. Gannett officials cited shared values; the Times Company was also a family-owned business, and its owners, the Blethen family, had roots in Maine. The Press Herald and its sister publications were reorganized as Blethen Maine Newspapers, an independent division of The Seattle Times Company. A paid advertisement in the newspaper's February 3, 2007, ""religion and values"" section, placed by the First Baptist Church of South Portland, listed the sermon as ""The Only Way to Destroy the Jewish Race""; this caused outrage in

Top Stories Michael Jordan's decision to sell Hornets leaves some team decisions in flux With the NBA's Board of Governors unlikely to approve the sale until at least another month, how should Charlotte approach the upcoming Draft and free agency period? Steve Reed | The Associated Press June 17, 2023 4:28 PM Michael Jordan plans to keep a minority stake in the Hornets, the team he bought in 2010 for about $275 million. CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The timing of Michael Jordan's decision to sell his majority ownership stake in the Charlotte Hornets has left the organization in flux, with several looming key personnel decisions. The Hornets have the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft on Thursday night. They also have some difficult decisions to make in free agency in early July, including whether to re-sign embattled restricted free-agent Miles Bridges. With the NBA's Board of Governors unlikely to approve the team's sale to an ownership group led by Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall until at least another month or two, the question becomes who'll sign off on general manager Mitch Kupchak's potentially franchise-altering decisions this summer? Will it be Jordan, a lame duck majority owner? Or will the new ownership have a major input? Jordan will remain on as a minority owner after the sale is approved, so he still has a vested interest in the organization. Bobby Marks, a front office insider for ESPN, said the timing of the announcement makes this a unique situation. ""Whether it's Mitch or Michael making the decisions, I think you have to keep these guys from the new ownership group in the loop,"" Marks said. ""... At the end of the day, they don't technically have a say in anything yet, but I would think they have to be part of the conversation, particularly when it comes to taking on future money."" But Marks said the trade rumors swirling around the New Orleans Pelicans potentially being open to moving former No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson in order to secure the second or third pick in the draft complicates things for the Hornets. Essentially, would a trade that has long-lasting implications sit well with new ownership? ""If they have a chance to move out of the two spot, what happens when you have salary involved that stretches past this year, which means money out of their pockets? I would think you would want to get (the new ownership group's) blessing before taking on money like that,"" Marks said. ESPN commentator Jeff Van Gundy agrees. ""I would suspect there would be conversations about who they want to draft and sign before anything is finalized,"" Van Gundy said. Both Marks and Van Gundy believe the toughest decision ahead involves whether or not to re-sign Bridges. A former first-round pick out of Michigan State, Bridges had a breakout season in 2021-22. He led the team in scoring and rebounding and appeared on the verge of a huge pay day last summer before felony domestic violence charges put his career on hold. The 25-year-old Bridges wound up pleading no contest to the charges and agreed to three years probation. He missed all of last season. The NBA ultimately determined Bridges will serve a 10-game suspension once he returns to the league. The league officially suspended him for 30 games, but determined 20 games of the suspension have already been served because Bridges already missed all 82 games in 2022-23. ""In terms of the new owners you have to wonder, is that what you want your first signing to be?"" Marks said. Added Van Gundy: ""There is more to that (decision) than just basketball."" Van Gundy believes the Hornets are in good hands in terms of personnel decisions with longtime NBA general manager Mitch Kupchak at the helm. He believes both Jordan and the new owners will rely heavily upon his opinion moving forward during this time of transition. As a player, Jordan was a six-time NBA Finals MVP, a 14-time All-Star and a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He's in the conversation as the greatest basketball player of all-time. But he never approached that level of success as an owner. The Hornets were 423-600 in his 13 years as majority owner and never won a playoff series. Charlotte has failed to reach the playoffs seven straight seasons, the longest drought in the NBA. Still, Van Gundy said he was surprised when reports first surfaced that Jordan was looking to sell the team. ""He always looked to be a hands-on owner,"" Van Gundy said. ""I know he has the fishing and the auto racing that he's involved in, but I still didn't expect him to get out of the NBA. And yet he looks like he is going to make a tidy profit, so good for him."" Jordan purchased the team for $275 million in 2010 and will sell it for a reported $3 billion. ""You win with Michael Jordan the player,"" Van Gundy added. ""Those type of players will make you elite for a long time. You see it with (Nikola) Jokic. It's hard to get those players, and when you do you are set up for a long period of time. ... But the Hornets, they missed on a few high draft picks."" After finishing 7-59 in the 2011-12 season, the Hornets failed to land the No. 1 pick in the lottery and missed out on star center Anthony Davis. Charlotte settled for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist at No. 2, passing on Bradley Beal and Damion Lillard. The Hornets also selected Cody Zeller fourth overall in 2013 instead over Giannis Antetokounmpo and Steven Adams, and swung and missed on top 10 picks Frank Kaminsky and Noah Vonleh in 2014 and 2015. ""It's about the roster, the roster, the roster,"" Van Gundy said. ""The most important person in every organization is the person who picks the players.""",4,1,5,5

David Richard Berkowitz (born Richard David Falco; June 1, 1953), also known as the Son of Sam and the .44 Caliber Killer, is an American serial killer who pled guilty to perpetrating eight shootings in New York City between July 1976 and July 1977, which resulted in six fatalities. Berkowitz grew up in New York City and served in the United States Army. Using a .44 Special caliber Bulldog revolver, he killed six people and wounded seven others by July 1977, terrorizing New Yorkers. Berkowitz eluded the biggest police manhunt in the city's history while leaving letters mocking the police and promising further crimes, which were highly publicized by the press. Berkowitz was arrested on August 10, 1977, and subsequently indicted for eight shootings. He confessed to all of them, and initially claimed to have been obeying the orders of a demon manifested in the form of a black dog belonging to his neighbor, ""Sam"". After being found mentally competent to stand trial, he pled guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences in state prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years. He subsequently admitted the dog-and-devil story was a hoax. In police investigations, Berkowitz was also implicated in many unsolved arsons in the city. Intense media coverage of the case lent a kind of celebrity status to Berkowitz, which many observers noted he seemed to enjoy. The New York State Legislature enacted new statutes, known popularly as ""Son of Sam laws"", designed to keep criminals from financially profiting from the publicity created by their crimes. The statutes have remained in New York despite various legal challenges, and similar laws have been enacted in several other states. During the mid-1990s, Berkowitz, by then professing to be a converted evangelical Christian, amended his confession to claim he had been a member of a violent Satanic cult that orchestrated the incidents as ritual murder. A new investigation of the murders began in 1996 but was suspended indefinitely after inconclusive findings. == Early life == David Berkowitz was born Richard David Falco on June 1, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York City.: 73 Within a few days of his birth, his biological mother, Elizabeth ""Betty"" Broder, gave the child away.: 80 Broder had grown up as part of an impoverished family and was working as a waitress. In 1936, she had married Tony Falco, an Italian American.: 76–9 After a marriage of less than four years, Falco left her for another woman.: 76 Berkowitz's biological father, Joseph Kleinman, was a married businessman who, like Berkowitz's mother, was Jewish. The infant Richard was adopted by Pearl and Nathan Berkowitz of the Bronx.: 16 The couple were Jewish hardware store retailers of modest means, and childless in middle age. They reversed the order of the boy's first and middle names and gave him their own surname, raising the young David Richard Berkowitz as their only child. Berkowitz had a bar mitzvah and was frequently bullied for being Jewish.: 57 Journalist John Vincent Sanders wrote that Berkowitz's childhood was ""somewhat troubled"". Although of above-average intelligence, he lost interest in his education at an early age and became infatuated with petty larceny and starting fires. He suffered head injuries as a child. Neighbors and relatives would recall Berkowitz as difficult, spoiled, and a bully. His adoptive parents consulted at least one psychotherapist due to his misconduct, but his misbehavior never resulted in a legal intervention or serious mention in his school records. He attended Public School #123 and Public School #77. Berkowitz's adoptive mother died of breast cancer when he was 14,: 18 and his home life became strained in later years, particularly because he disliked his adoptive father's second wife.: 60–1 Berkowitz lived with his father while attending Christopher Columbus High School (graduating in 1971) and college in a four-and-a-half-room apartment at 170 Dreis",1,1,5,1
39,what countries does the panama canal go through?,Panama,Panama Canal Zone,"The Panama Canal (Spanish: Canal de Panamá) is an artificial 82-kilometer (51-mile) waterway in Panama that connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean. It cuts across the narrowest point of the Isthmus of Panama, and is a conduit for maritime trade between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial fresh water lake 26 meters (85 ft) above sea level, created by damming the Chagres River and Lake Alajuela to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal. Locks then lower the ships at the other end. An average of 200 ML (52,000,000 US gal) of fresh water is used in a single passing of a ship. The canal is threatened by low water levels during droughts. The Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage, the Strait of Magellan or the Beagle Channel. Its construction was one of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken. Since its inauguration on August 15, 1914, the canal has succeeded in shortening maritime communication in time and distance, invigorating maritime and economic transportation by providing a short and relatively inexpensive transit route between the two oceans, decisively influencing global trade patterns, boosting economic growth in developed and developing countries, as well as providing the basic impetus for economic expansion in many remote regions of the world. Colombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped in 1889 because of a lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The US took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal in 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for its handover to Panama in 1977. After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, the Panamanian government took control in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the Panamanian government-owned Panama Canal Authority. The original locks are 33.5 meters (110 ft) wide and allow the passage of Panamax ships. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded waterway began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow for the transit of larger, Neopanamax ships. Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal; in that year, the United States, China, Chile, Japan, and South Korea were the top five users of the canal. In 2017, it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal's two outer locks. The American Society of Civil Engineers has ranked the Panama Canal one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. == History == === Early proposals in Panama === The earliest record concerning a possible canal across Central America is from 1534. Seeking to gain a military advantage over the Portuguese, the Spanish ruler Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, ordered a survey of a route through the Americas in order to ease the voyage for ships traveling between Spain and Peru. In 1668, the English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne speculated in his encyclopedic work, Pseudodoxia Epidemica, that ""some Isthmus have been eaten through by the Sea, and others cut by the spade: And if the policy would permit, that of Panama in America were most worthy the attempt: it being but few miles over, and would open a shorter cut unto the East Indies and China"". Given the strategic location of Panama, and the potential of its narrow isthmus separating two great ocea

Panama, officially the Republic of Panama, is a country in Latin America at the southern end of Central America, bordering South America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Its capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's over 4 million inhabitants. Before the arrival of Spanish colonists in the 16th century, Panama was inhabited by a number of different indigenous tribes. It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. The 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties agreed to transfer the canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999. The surrounding territory was returned first, in 1979. Revenue from canal tolls has continued to represent a significant portion of Panama's GDP, especially after the Panama Canal expansion project (finished in 2016) doubled its capacity. Commerce, banking, and tourism are major sectors. Panama is regarded as having a high-income economy. In 2019, Panama ranked 57th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index. In 2018, Panama was ranked the seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. Panama was ranked 82rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024. Covering around 40 percent of its land area, Panama's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals – some of them found nowhere else on earth. Panama is a founding member of the United Nations and other international organizations such as the Organization of American States, Latin America Integration Association, Group of 77, World Health Organization, and Non-Aligned Movement. == Etymology == The definite origin of the name Panama is unknown. There are several theories. One states that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree (Sterculia apetala, the Panama tree). Another states that the first settlers arrived in Panama in August, when butterflies are abundant, and that the name means ""many butterflies"" in one or several of the indigenous American Indian languages that were spoken in the territory prior to the Spanish colonization. Another theory states that the word is a Castilianization of the Kuna language word ""bannaba"" which means ""distant"" or ""far away"". A commonly relayed legend in Panama is that there was a fishing village that bore the name ""Panamá"", which purportedly meant ""an abundance of fish"", when the Spanish colonists first landed in the area. The exact location of the village is unknown. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzmán's diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a ""small indigenous fishing town"". In 1517, Don Gaspar de Espinosa, a Spanish lieutenant, decided to build a trading post in the same location Guzmán described. In 1519, Pedro Arias Dávila decided to establish the Spanish Empire's Pacific port at the site. The new settlement replaced Santa María la Antigua del Darién, which had lost its function within the Crown's global plan after the Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific began. The official definition and origin of the name as promoted by Panama's Ministry of Education is the ""abundance of fish, trees and butterflies"". This is the usual description given in social studies textbooks. == History == === Pre-Columbian period === The Isthmus of Panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridg

Connecting the world through the Panama Canal The Panama Canal has improved global commerce, transportation, and connectivity for more than 100 years. Through its shortened route and strategic location, the Panama Canal continues to expand its partnerships across the world and innovate its services to uphold its commitment to creating, capturing and rendering value to its customers and Panama. Connecting 170 Countries Since the opening of the Neopanamax Locks in 2016, the Panama Canal has come to serve 36 new maritime routes, connecting an additional 220 ports and 10 countries. Today, the waterway serves a total of 180 maritime routes that link 1,920 ports across 170 countries. Through this expanded number of routes, new terminals have become points of origin or destination for cargo that transits the Canal, such as the liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals of Cove Point and Cameron in the United States and Port of Point Fortin in Trinidad and Tobago. The United States remains the top user country of the Panama Canal, with two-thirds of cargo transported through the waterway originating from or destined for this market, followed by China and Japan. The main route using the waterway by cargo tonnage runs between the U.S. East Coast and Asia. It is followed by the U.S. East Coast and the West Coast of South America, Europe and the West Coast South America, the U.S. East Coast and the West Coast of Central America, and the South America intercoastal route. Facilitating Grain Exports Traditionally, the dry bulk market has been and continues to be important in terms of the cargo tonnage transported through the Panama Canal. The main commodities moved in bulk cargo vessels consist of soybeans, corn and miscellaneous grains. The grain flows originate in U.S. ports located on the Gulf of Mexico region destined for China, the West Coast of South America, Japan and the West Coast of Central America. Soybeans are the most prominent commodity crop that navigates the Mississippi river to be shipped through U.S. ports bound for China. Corn shipments from the same ports are often bound for Japan and Peru. In the last months, grain exports through the Canal have increased as U.S. exporters meet soybean demand to feed livestock and poultry in China. Energizing the Market - LNG and LPG Trade While various market segments have contributed to the Canal's widened reach, the LNG and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market segments saw exponential growth in recent months. The world's global economic recovery, combined with record low temperatures during the winter in Asia, heightened demand for energy during what was already peak season. The LPG segment saw particularly high growth during the Canal's 2020 fiscal year (FY2020), which ran between October 2019 and September 2020, recording Panama Canal tons (PC/UMS) tonnage 27 percent higher than projected. In that same period, 95 percent of LPG traveling through the waterway originated from the U.S., followed by Trinidad & Tobago with almost 3 percent. Almost half (49 percent) of all U.S. LPG exports passed through Panama Canal during this time, with a majority destined for either South Korea or Japan. Connectivity Through the Green Route As the Panama Canal's network expands, so does its positive environmental impact. Already, the Canal has contributed to a reduction of more than 830 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) since opening by allowing vessels to save time and fuel through reduced voyages and fewer cargo movements compared to freight transportation via air, truck or rail. The Panama Canal has been able to steadily manage the water issue, to safeguard an operational level of water and its longstanding reliability for customers. This dry season, the Canal saw positive results from the measures implemented last year. The Panama Canal was able to secure a steady draft for this period through the waterway, allowing shippers to carry more cargo using the Panama route. Through its unprecedented connectivity, the Panama Canal has facilitated the development of world maritime trade, unlocking opportunities for connectivity and exchange between countries and markets. We are a link in a chain where reliability is the most valued attribute, and we are committed to continuing to invest in and build upon our role in connecting the world.

What is the Panama Canal? The Panama Canal is a constructed waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans across the Isthmus of Panama. It is owned and administered by Panama, and it is 40 miles long from shoreline to shoreline. Ships can cross going in either direction, and it takes about 10 hours to get from one side to the other. Ships from any country are treated equally with respect to conditions of passage and tolls. Why is the Panama Canal important? Before the Panama Canal was built, ships traveling between the east and west coasts of the American continents had to go around Cape Horn in South America, a voyage that was some 8,000 nautical miles longer then going through the canal and that took about two months to complete. All journeys between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are shortened by thousands of nautical miles by going through the canal. Why does the Panama Canal need locks? A mountain range runs the length of Panama, including through the Canal Zone, though it is lower there. In addition, the tidal levels of the oceans on either side of the Panama Canal differ. Locks raise ships to the level of the lakes (which account for about half the distance of the canal) and then lower them to sea level. Panama Canal, lock-type canal, owned and administered by the Republic of Panama, that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow Isthmus of Panama. The length of the Panama Canal from shoreline to shoreline is about 40 miles (65 km) and from deep water in the Atlantic (more specifically, the Caribbean Sea) to deep water in the Pacific about 50 miles (82 km). The canal, which was completed in August 1914, is one of the two most strategic artificial waterways in the world, the other being the Suez Canal. Ships sailing between the east and west coasts of the United States, which otherwise would be obliged to round Cape Horn in South America, shorten their voyage by about 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km) by using the canal. Savings of up to 3,500 nautical miles (6,500 km) are also made on voyages between one coast of North America and ports on the other side of South America. Ships sailing between Europe and East Asia or Australia can save as much as 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) by using the canal. From its opening in 1914 until 1979, the Panama Canal was controlled solely by the United States, which built it. In 1979, however, control of the canal passed to the Panama Canal Commission, a joint agency of the United States and the Republic of Panama, and complete control passed to Panama at noon on December 31, 1999. Administration of the canal is the responsibility of the Panama Canal Authority (Spanish: Autoridad del Canal de Panama [ACP]), which answers solely to the government of Panama. Physical features The canal The Panama Canal lies at a latitude of 9deg N, at a point where the North American Continental Divide dips to one of its lowest points. The canal does not, as is generally supposed, cross the isthmus from east to west. It runs due south from its entrance at Colon on the Atlantic side through the Gatun Locks to a point in the widest portion of Gatun Lake; it then turns sharply toward the east and follows a course generally to the southeast until it reaches the Bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Its terminus near Balboa is some 25 miles (40 km) east of its terminus near Colon. Parallel to the canal are the Panama Canal Railway and the Boyd-Roosevelt Highway. In passing from the Atlantic to the Pacific, vessels enter the approach channel in Limon Bay, which extends a distance of about 7 miles (11 km) to the Gatun Locks. At Gatun a series of three locks lifts vessels 85 feet (26 meters) to Gatun Lake. The lake, formed by Gatun Dam on the Chagres River and supplemented by waters from Alajuela Lake (Lake Madden; formed by the Madden Dam), covers an area of 166 square miles (430 square km). The channel through the lake varies in depth from 46 to 85 feet (14 to 26 meters) and extends for about 23 miles (37 km) to Gamboa. Gaillard (Culebra) Cut begins at Gamboa and passes through the Continental Divide. The channel through the cut has an average depth of about 43 feet (13 meters) and extends some 8 miles (13 km) to the Pedro Miguel Locks. The locks lower vessels 30 feet (9 meters) to Miraflores Lake, at an elevation of 52 feet (16 meters) above sea level. Vessels then pass through a channel almost 1.2 miles (2 km) long to the two-stepped locks at Miraflores, where they are lowered to sea level. The final segment of the canal is a dredged approach passage 7 miles long through which ships pass into the Pacific. Throughout its length the canal has a minimum bottom width of 500 feet (150 meters); in Gatun Lake the width of the channel varies between 500 and 1,000 feet (150 and 300 meters), and in Miraflores Lake the width is 740 feet (225 meters).",1,1,1,5

Horton Hears a Who! (also known as Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who! or simply Horton) is a 2008 American animated adventure comedy film based on the 1954 book of the same name by Dr. Seuss, produced by Blue Sky Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The film was directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino, from a screenplay written by the writing team of Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. It stars the voices of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell as Horton the Elephant and Mayor Ned McDodd, respectively, alongside Carol Burnett, Will Arnett, Seth Rogen, Dan Fogler, Isla Fisher, Jonah Hill, and Amy Poehler. Recurring Blue Sky collaborator John Powell composed the film's musical score. It is the fourth screen adaptation of the book following the 1970 Chuck Jones television special, the 1987 Soviet animated short, and the 1992 Russian animated short. The film was released theatrically on March 14, 2008, to generally positive reviews, and grossed $298 million on a budget of $85 million. Horton Hears a Who! was the third Dr. Seuss feature film adaptation, the first adaptation to be fully animated using CGI technology, the first and so far only theatrical film adaptation to receive positive reviews, and the second Dr. Seuss film starring Jim Carrey after How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). == Plot == In the Jungle of Nool, Horton the Elephant, the jungle's eccentric nature teacher, hears a tiny yelp coming from a floating dust speck and gives chase to it before placing it on top of a flower. Horton finds out the speck harbors the city of Whoville and its inhabitants, the Whos, led by Mayor Ned McDodd, whose family includes his wife, Sally; 96 daughters whose names all begin with the letter H; and one teenage son named JoJo. Despite being the oldest child and next in line for the mayoral position, JoJo does not want to be the next mayor, and he does not speak due to his fear of disappointing his father. Once Horton begins carrying the speck with him, the city starts experiencing strange phenomena (earthquakes and changes in the weather), and the mayor finds his attempts to caution Whoville challenged by the town council, led by the opportunistic yet condescending chairman. After he makes contact with Horton, the mayor finds out from Dr. Mary Lou LaRue that Whoville will be destroyed if Horton does not find a safe location for the speck to reside. With the help of his best friend Morton the mouse, Horton decides to place the speck atop Mt. Nool, the safest place in the jungle. The head of the jungle, the Sour Kangaroo, who despises Horton for his lackadaisical influence on the children and subsequently ""pouch-schooling"" her son Rudy, demands numerous times that Horton give up the speck for overshadowing her authority, but Horton refuses. Also taking force toward Horton are the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys and lackeys to the Kangaroo who like to cause havoc around the jungle. Eventually, the Kangaroo, refusing to believe that the Whos exist, enlists a sinister but idiotic vulture named Vlad Vladikoff to get rid of the speck by force. After a few failed attempts, Vlad manages to steal the flower away from Horton and drops it into a massive field of identical pink flowers causing an apocalyptic tremor in Whoville. After unsuccessfully picking flowers all day, Horton eventually recovers the flower (exactly the 3,000,000th flower), also revealing himself to the rest of Whoville, who have largely survived. The Kangaroo eventually finds out that Horton still has the speck, fires Vlad, and rallies the jungle community into arresting Horton, preying on their fears that their own children will become chaotic delinquents under his influence. Upon cornering him, the Kangaroo offers Horton a final chance to renounce Whoville's existence. Horton refuses, and despite the heartfelt speech that he gives, the Kangaroo orders the animals to rope and cage him, and to have the speck and Whoville destroyed in a pot of beezlenut oil.

The fourth season of the American television sitcom Cheers aired on NBC from September 26, 1985 to May 15, 1986. This season marks Woody Harrelson's television debut as Woody Boyd after Nicholas Colasanto, who portrayed Coach Ernie Pantusso, died during the previous season. The show was created by director James Burrows and writers Glen and Les Charles, under production team Charles Burrows Charles Productions, in association with Paramount Television. == Background == During the previous season, 1984–85, after two years of struggling with low ratings, rapid schedule changes, and failed series, NBC's Thursday night lineup (years before the Must See TV promotional slogan was developed) consisted of, in time slot order starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern / 7:00 p.m. Central: The Cosby Show, Family Ties, Cheers, Night Court, and Hill Street Blues, and became a ratings success for the network. The 1985–86 Thursday schedule was similar to the previous season's and was still a success. == Cast and characters == Ted Danson as Sam Malone — bartender, owner, retired Red Sox relief pitcher Shelley Long as Diane Chambers — snobby waitress, the moral compass of the bar staff and patrons Rhea Perlman as Carla Tortelli — bitter waitress, divorced mother of six. Gives birth to Ludlow, named after his father Dr. Bennett Ludlow, Frasier's mentor. John Ratzenberger as Cliff Clavin — postal carrier and virginal, loquacious bar know-it-all Woody Harrelson as Woody Boyd — dim small town Indiana bar-tender, hired by Sam to fill-in for the coach's absence following the latter's death. George Wendt as Norm Peterson — a semi-unemployed accountant, a childless husband Kelsey Grammer as Frasier Crane (recurring) — jilted psychiatrist Recurring and credited in the end credits, though appears in most episodes. In remastered prints of the episode ""Cliffie's Big Score"", seen on DVD and later syndication, Grammer's name appears in the opening credits, although he does not appear in the episode and is not officially credited in the opening until Season 5. During the previous season, Sam went to Italy to stop Frasier and Diane's wedding. This season, he fails to do so, and returns to Boston. Several months later, Frasier comes to the bar to announce that Diane jilted him at the altar, made love to other men, and is now in a convent, located one hour away from Boston. Sam retrieves Diane from the convent and rehires her as a bar waitress. After having lost everything, including his career, Frasier frequently visits the Boston bar, Cheers, for drinks and then slowly degenerates into alcoholism. He recovers, then begins another psychiatric job, distancing himself from Sam and Diane's relationship. Sam then begins a relationship with the city councillor Janet Eldrige (Kate Mulgrew). Tired of being part the triangle with Sam and Diane, Janet breaks up with Sam. In the season's finale, during a telephone call, Sam proposes to an unidentified woman. == Episodes == == Production == During filming of the series' third season, Nicholas Colasanto, who portrayed regular character Coach Ernie Pantusso, died of a heart attack. Rather than recast the character, Coach was written out. In the season's premiere episode, ""Birth, Death, Love and Rice"", it was revealed that the character of Coach had died, although no explanation was given. As a replacement for Coach, the show's producers created a new character, Woody Boyd, ""an Indiana farm boy"" who becomes a bartender in the bar of big city Boston, portrayed by Woody Harrelson. Before Cheers, Harrelson was an understudy in a Broadway play, Biloxi Blues, and made his film debut in Wildcats, which was released to theaters in February 1986. == Reception == In the 1985–86 season, Cheers was scheduled at 9:00 p.m. (Eastern) / 8:00 p.m. (Central) against CBS's Simon & Simon and ABC's The Colbys, which replaced Lady Blue, which moved to Saturdays in mid-November 1985.

41,who plays bob kelso in scrubs?,"Ken Jenkins played Bob Kelso in the early seasons of Scrubs. However, the character was primarily portrayed by Ken Jenkins until 2007. After that, the role was taken over by Michael Ealy.",Ken Jenkins,"Robert ""Bob"" Kelso, M.D., is a fictional character played by Ken Jenkins in the American comedy-drama Scrubs. Bob Kelso is the chief of medicine for Sacred Heart Hospital for the first seven seasons of Scrubs (a position held since 1984), though he resigns in the episode ""My Dumb Luck"". Kelso appeared in every episode during the first eight seasons except three Season 8 episodes, ""My Last Words"", ""Their Story II"" and ""My Full Moon"". Jenkins was a regular cast member for the first eight seasons, and appeared in nine episodes of season nine. == Profile == Of all the Scrubs characters, he goes through the most pronounced change as the series progresses. In the first few seasons, he appears to be a cynical, heartless man who gives mere lip service to patients' well-being, putting more value on the hospital's bottom line and his own personal comfort. In a moment of brutal candor in the series premiere, Kelso tells series protagonist John ""J.D."" Dorian, ""Do you not realize that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me?"" Throughout the series, though, events suggest that Kelso's cynicism is a defense mechanism to deal with the pressures of his position. In later seasons he gradually becomes more compassionate, and after retirement, he remains in the other characters' lives as a grandfatherly figure. Throughout the series, he is at odds with Dr. Perry Cox (John C. McGinley), Sacred Heart's Chief Attending Physician who eventually replaces him as Chief of Medicine. Cox calls him ""Bobbo"" or some other variation, often refers to him as a ""pod person"" or ""the Devil himself"", and once even punches him out. The two have occasionally shared moments of understanding and compassion, however, such as when Kelso tells a depressed Cox that the hospital and Kelso himself needs him, as they balance each other out to do what is best for the hospital. After his retirement, Kelso becomes more openly friendly with Cox. His wife, Enid, and children are never seen on the show, although he frequently comments on his spouse, describing her as morbidly obese, neurotic, and using a wheelchair after an accident that left her paralyzed. Enid was a nurse working at the hospital during his early days as an M.D. and he has one child by her, a son called Harrison, a gay, drug-dealing heavy metal fan who wrote a scathing musical about him titled Dr. Dad and ""shacked up"" with the actor playing Kelso. Kelso also has a secret love child, Trong Tri Kelso, by a Vietnamese woman he had an affair with during his tour in Vietnam. Although he considers his children to be embarrassing, it is shown he genuinely loves Harrison and pays for Trong Tri's college education. He frequently cheats on his wife, and is open about his love of prostitutes. Kelso also suffers from a sexually transmitted disease which he has kept hidden from Enid. Kelso was born in 1942 in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, where his family, then named Kelsonovich, settled. His father, also a doctor, endeared himself to his poorer patients by accepting gifts such as food and clothing in lieu of actual payment. The elder Kelso was apparently less generous to his own family, however, and he left the family on Kelso's own bicycle (an event to which Kelso attributes his irrational hatred of bikes). Before becoming a doctor, Kelso had a promising career as a shortstop; however, his treatment of other players earned him a permanent ban from the Appalachian League. Kelso attended medical school at Stanford University, graduating in 1968. Kelso was in the United States Navy SEALs during the Vietnam War. He has a tattoo of the word ""Johnny"" on his buttocks (""...he's an old sailor buddy, and if you went through what we did, you'd understand""). In the seventh season, he turns 65, which is the hospital's mandatory retirement age. The hospital board of directors begins actively searching for a replacement, but Kelso's forced retirement is headed off with the help of the staff. He then decides to retire on his own ter

42,what college did joakim noah?,Illinois,University of Florida,"Lamar Joseph Odom (born November 6, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player. As a member of the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA), he won championships in 2009 and 2010 and was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011. In high school, Odom received national player of the year honors from Parade in 1997. He played college basketball for the University of Rhode Island, earning all-conference honors during his only season in the Atlantic 10 Conference before turning professional. The Los Angeles Clippers selected Odom with the fourth overall pick in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team in the following year; it was during his four seasons with the Clippers, however, that he was twice suspended for violating the league's anti-drug policy. As a restricted free agent, he then signed with the Miami Heat, where he played the 2003–04 season before being traded to the Lakers. Odom spent seven seasons with the Lakers, who traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. After the move, his career declined. He was traded back to the Clippers in 2012 and played briefly in Spain in 2014. Odom played on the United States national team, winning a bronze medal in the Olympics in 2004 and a gold medal in the FIBA World Championship (later known as the World Cup) in 2010. Odom was married to Khloé Kardashian from 2009 to 2016. During their marriage, Odom made several appearances on the reality television show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. He and Kardashian also had their own reality series, Khloé & Lamar. In October 2015, Odom was hospitalized in a comatose state after being discovered unconscious in a Nevada brothel. He later sought treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. == Early life == Odom was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York City, to Joe Odom and Cathy Mercer. His father was a heroin addict. His mother died of colon cancer when he was only 12 years old. On her deathbed, she reportedly told him: ""Be nice to everybody."" Odom was afterwards raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer. In his first three years of high school, Odom played for Christ the King Regional High School in Middle Village, Queens. He left the school at the start of his senior year due to poor grades, transferring first to Redemption Christian Academy in Troy, New York, and then to the now-defunct St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New Britain, Connecticut, where he was coached by Jerry DeGregorio. As a senior, Odom was recognized nationally as the Parade Player of the Year in 1997. Among other distinctions, he earned USA Today All-USA First Team honors and was named to the Parade All-American First Team for the second consecutive year. While still in high school, Odom played on the same AAU team as future NBA teammates Elton Brand and Ron Artest (later known as Metta World Peace); he also played at the Adidas ABCD Camp with future Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant. Adidas executive Sonny Vaccaro commented at the time that Odom possessed a ""$2 million smile"". == College career == Though he considered entering the NBA directly from high school and consulted Kobe Bryant as a player who had made that jump, Odom ultimately decided that he was not ready and committed to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas instead. However, a Sports Illustrated story questioning the validity of his ACT score and an arrest for soliciting prostitution provided the school cause enough to revoke his scholarship, and for this reason, he never played for the Runnin' Rebels. To the university's further embarrassment, an investigation by the NCAA would later reveal that Odom had received $5,600 in illicit payments from one of its boosters, resulting in the firing of Coach Bill Bayno and UNLV being placed on probation for four years. Odom transferred to the University of Rhode Island, with the cost of his room and board being covered by funds his father received from the G.I. Bill. Since he was ad

Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ, is an American businessman and former professional basketball player. He played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon. His profile on the NBA website states, ""By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."" Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames ""Air Jordan"" and ""His Airness"". Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. He returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999, returning for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards. He was selected to play for the United States national team during his college and NBA careers, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated. Jordan's individual accolades include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, 10 All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game). He is one of only eight players to achieve the basketball Triple Crown. In 1999, Jordan was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (""The Dream Team""). He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a ""Dream Team"" member in 2017. Jordan was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996 and to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. The trophy for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award is named in his honor. One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular. Jordan starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film Space Jam (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. Jordan is also a co-o

David Richard Berkowitz (born Richard David Falco; June 1, 1953), also known as the Son of Sam and the .44 Caliber Killer, is an American serial killer who pled guilty to perpetrating eight shootings in New York City between July 1976 and July 1977, which resulted in six fatalities. Berkowitz grew up in New York City and served in the United States Army. Using a .44 Special caliber Bulldog revolver, he killed six people and wounded seven others by July 1977, terrorizing New Yorkers. Berkowitz eluded the biggest police manhunt in the city's history while leaving letters mocking the police and promising further crimes, which were highly publicized by the press. Berkowitz was arrested on August 10, 1977, and subsequently indicted for eight shootings. He confessed to all of them, and initially claimed to have been obeying the orders of a demon manifested in the form of a black dog belonging to his neighbor, ""Sam"". After being found mentally competent to stand trial, he pled guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences in state prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years. He subsequently admitted the dog-and-devil story was a hoax. In police investigations, Berkowitz was also implicated in many unsolved arsons in the city. Intense media coverage of the case lent a kind of celebrity status to Berkowitz, which many observers noted he seemed to enjoy. The New York State Legislature enacted new statutes, known popularly as ""Son of Sam laws"", designed to keep criminals from financially profiting from the publicity created by their crimes. The statutes have remained in New York despite various legal challenges, and similar laws have been enacted in several other states. During the mid-1990s, Berkowitz, by then professing to be a converted evangelical Christian, amended his confession to claim he had been a member of a violent Satanic cult that orchestrated the incidents as ritual murder. A new investigation of the murders began in 1996 but was suspended indefinitely after inconclusive findings. == Early life == David Berkowitz was born Richard David Falco on June 1, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York City.: 73 Within a few days of his birth, his biological mother, Elizabeth ""Betty"" Broder, gave the child away.: 80 Broder had grown up as part of an impoverished family and was working as a waitress. In 1936, she had married Tony Falco, an Italian American.: 76–9 After a marriage of less than four years, Falco left her for another woman.: 76 Berkowitz's biological father, Joseph Kleinman, was a married businessman who, like Berkowitz's mother, was Jewish. The infant Richard was adopted by Pearl and Nathan Berkowitz of the Bronx.: 16 The couple were Jewish hardware store retailers of modest means, and childless in middle age. They reversed the order of the boy's first and middle names and gave him their own surname, raising the young David Richard Berkowitz as their only child. Berkowitz had a bar mitzvah and was frequently bullied for being Jewish.: 57 Journalist John Vincent Sanders wrote that Berkowitz's childhood was ""somewhat troubled"". Although of above-average intelligence, he lost interest in his education at an early age and became infatuated with petty larceny and starting fires. He suffered head injuries as a child. Neighbors and relatives would recall Berkowitz as difficult, spoiled, and a bully. His adoptive parents consulted at least one psychotherapist due to his misconduct, but his misbehavior never resulted in a legal intervention or serious mention in his school records. He attended Public School #123 and Public School #77. Berkowitz's adoptive mother died of breast cancer when he was 14,: 18 and his home life became strained in later years, particularly because he disliked his adoptive father's second wife.: 60–1 Berkowitz lived with his father while attending Christopher Columbus High School (graduating in 1971) and college in a four-and-a-half-room apartment at 170 Dreis",1,1,5,1

East Los Angeles (Spanish: Este de Los Ángeles), or East L.A., is an unincorporated area situated within Los Angeles County, California, United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, East Los Angeles is designated as a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes. The most recent data from the 2020 census reports a population of 118,786, reflecting a 6.1% decrease compared to the 2010 population of 126,496. The concentration of Hispanic/Latino Americans is 95.16 percent, the highest of any city or census-designated place in the United States outside of Puerto Rico. == History == === Original East Los Angeles === Historically, when it was founded in 1873, the neighborhood northeast of downtown known today as Lincoln Heights was originally named East Los Angeles, but in 1917, residents voted to change the name to its present name. Today, it is considered part of Eastside Los Angeles, the geographic region east of the Los Angeles River that includes three neighborhoods within the city of Los Angeles (Boyle Heights, El Sereno, and Lincoln Heights) and the unincorporated community in Los Angeles County known today as ""East Los Angeles"". Lincoln Heights is 4 miles (6 km) northwest of present-day East Los Angeles. When Lincoln Heights, the first Eastside subdivision created in 1873, changed its name in 1917, Belvedere (Belvedere Gardens and Belvedere Heights) and surrounding unincorporated county areas were given the moniker of East Los Angeles. By the 1930s, most maps had started to label the Belvedere area as ""East Los Angeles"". === Belvedere === The cornerstone of the first building of Occidental College was laid in September 1887 on Rowan Street. In 1896, the building was destroyed by fire. On April 2, 1905, it was reported that the Janss Investment Company would be developing an area ""on Boyle Heights"" (later, Boyle Heights would refer only to a smaller area to the west, i.e. the neighborhood now called Boyle Heights within the Los Angeles city limits). The 170-acre (0.69 km2) tract was located at the eastern terminus of the Los Angeles Railway's ""R"" streetcar line. Originally known as ""Hazard's Eastside Extension"", was to be named Highland Villa, but would later be rechristened Belvedere Heights. Belvedere Heights, at its launch in 1905, extended from the L.A. city limits (Indiana Av.) on the west to Rowan Av. on the east, from Aliso St. on the south to Wabash Av. on the north, the northwestern portion of today's East Los Angeles, thus including the lower portions of what today is called City Terrace. By the early 1920s, workers in the sprouting industrial district to the south were seeking nearby housing. At the time, the unincorporated region was undeveloped and or preserved for agriculture and oil extraction. Belvedere township included the territory that in 1902 became the city of Montebello. By 1922 Janss advertised that it had sold 6000 lots there and that 35,000 people lived in Belvedere Heights. Buildings that were described as being in Belvedere Heights included the junior high school on Record between Brooklyn and Michigan, now called Belvedere Middle School. In February 1921 Janss announced that it had purchased 150 acres (61 ha) adjacent to the end of the streetcar line on Stephenson Avenue, now Whittier Boulevard, south of Belvedere Heights, and divided the empty land into housing lots of square-mile grid cells. Janss called the new tract Belvedere Gardens, an area still found today on maps for the area east of the Long Beach Freeway. The area was able to avoid being annexed into the City of Los Angeles because of a private groundwater utility formed in 1926 now known as the California Water Service, which would later become a customer of the Metropolitan Water District. Prior to the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, governing bodies would set property taxes independently, which led to a cumulative overlapping rate including bond taxes for large infrastructure projects such as th

Brentwood is a suburban neighborhood in the Westside region of Los Angeles, California. == History == === General === Modern development began after the establishment of the 600-acre (2.4 km2) Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Soldiers and Sailors in the 1880s. A small community sprang up outside that facility's west gate, taking on the name Westgate. Annexed by the City of Los Angeles on June 14, 1916, Westgate's 49 sq mi (130 km2) included large parts of what is now the Pacific Palisades and a small portion of today's Bel-Air. Westgate Avenue is one of the last reminders of that namesake. Local traditions include a Maypole erected each year on the lawn of the Archer School for Girls, carrying on that set by the Eastern Star Home previously housed there. This building was the exterior establishing shot for the ""Mar Vista Rest Home"" that provided a key scene in the 1974 film Chinatown. === Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone designation === The State Cal-Fire Authority officially designated Brentwood, from Mulholland down to Sunset Boulevard, a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, due to the long, uninterrupted border of urban-wildlife interface in the hillsides that has resulted in multiple fires over many years, destroying entire neighborhoods and requiring numerous evacuations. For this reason, the Brentwood community has been strongly in favor of halting all further development in the hillside and canyon areas. On November 6, 1961, a construction crew working in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley north of Brentwood on the far side of the Santa Monica Mountains noticed smoke and flames in a nearby pile of rubbish. Within minutes, Santa Ana winds gusting up to 60 mph (100 km/h) sent burning brush aloft and over the ridge into Brentwood. More than 300 police officers helped evacuate 3,500 residents during the 12-hour fire, and some 2,500 firefighters battled the blaze, pumping water from neighborhood swimming pools to douse flames. Pockets of the fire smoldered for several days. Even as firefighters battled what was to become a Bel Air disaster, another fire erupted in Santa Ynez Canyon to the west. That blaze was contained the next day after consuming nearly 10,000 acres (40 km2) and nine structures and burning to within a mile of Bel Air and Brentwood. The fires were the fifth-worst conflagration in the nation's history at the time, burning 16,090 acres (65 km2), destroying more than 484 homes and 190 other structures and causing an estimated $30 million in damage. === O. J. Simpson murder case === Brentwood was the site of the 1994 stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, outside Nicole Brown Simpson's Bundy Drive townhouse. Nicole's ex-husband, football player and actor O. J. Simpson, was acquitted of the murders, but was later found liable for the deaths in a civil trial. O. J. Simpson's Brentwood home was subsequently sold. The new owners demolished Simpson's home and built a new residence. == Geography == === Boundaries === The district is located at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains, bounded by the San Diego Freeway on the east, Wilshire Boulevard on the south, the Santa Monica city limits on the southwest, Sullivan Canyon/Westridge Trail on the west and Mulholland Drive on the north. === Environment === Brentwood, like nearby Santa Monica, has a temperate climate influenced by water breezes off the Pacific Ocean. Residents frequently wake to a ""marine layer"", sunshine and birds singing. The topography is generally split into two characters, broadly divided by Sunset Boulevard: the area north of Sunset is defined by ridges and canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains and is located in a Cal-Fire designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone; south of Sunset the area is mostly flat. The area south of San Vicente Boulevard features an underground spring which bubbles up into a small creek along ""the Gully"" near the Brentwood Country Club. == Demographics == T",1,1,5,1

Sneaker collecting is the acquisition and trading of sneakers as a hobby. It is often manifested by the use and collection of shoes made for particular sports, particularly basketball and skateboarding. A person involved in sneaker collecting is sometimes called a sneakerhead. Sneaker collecting came to prominence in the 1980s in New York City and can be attributed to two major sources: basketball, specifically the emergence of Michael Jordan and his eponymous Air Jordan line of shoes released in 1985, and the growth of hip hop music. The boom of signature basketball shoes during this era provided the sheer variety necessary for a collecting subculture, while the hip-hop movement gave the sneakers their street credibility as status symbols. Sneakerhead culture has extended beyond shoes designed for particular sports, and overlaps with streetwear trends and styles. By one estimate, the sneaker resale market was worth US$10 billion in 2021. == History == Consumers started to collect, trade and resell sneakers in the 1970s, and the sneakerhead subculture came to prominence in New York City during the 1980s. Sneakers such as the Adidas Superstar and Puma Suede were popularized by b-boys and hip-hop artists, and Nike's Air Jordan line revolutionized the industry with its marketing linked to superstar basketball player Michael Jordan. During the 1960s and 1970s, street basketball was widely played in the streets of the Bronx. One of the important rituals among the players was ""stepsies"", which was a game for everyone to step on a player's new sneakers. A clean pair of sneakers indicated that the player was weak. However, with the rise of hip hop music, a ""clean and fresh"" look gained popularity and the game of ""stepsies"" lost favor. Since the 1970s, there has been a strict rule against combining rival brands. For example, a person wearing Nike sneakers with Adidas track pants would be considered as someone going against the culture. This type of violation lowers a person's reputation and shows their lack of awareness of the culture, similar to forgetting to remove the tag from a designer suit. This practice led sneakerheads to favor one brand over another, resulting in strong brand loyalty. Although the concept of brand exclusively has diminished, the art of mixing brands properly has evolved as streetwear, luxury fashion, and sportswear became significant aspects of sneaker culture. Sneaker culture became global by the end of the 1990s. Originally popular among urban black youth and white skateboarders, by the 21st century it had gained a sizable Asian following. Sneakers have had cult followings in Japan since the 1990s, where many American fashion brands remain highly covetable. Outside the US, Japan is one of the only markets where limited-edition styles (particularly Nikes) have had region-exclusive releases. == Culture == Sneaker collectors buy online and go to outlets, sneaker events, swapmeets, parties, and gatherings in search of rare, vintage, and limited edition shoes. New launches of popular sneaker models increasingly take place via online raffles through mobile apps. Collectible sneakers can usually be resold for well above their original retail price, including certain collaborations with various athletes and celebrities. Popular fashion trends in sneaker culture usually overlap with streetwear trends and styles. Sneakerheads often participate in both online and offline activities to show their enthusiasm in sneakers. Typical example of offline activity is participating in sneaker exhibitions. Some of the notable exhibitions include Sneakercon in North America and Southeast Asia, Sneakerness in Europe, and Faces&Laces in Russia. Through these exhibitions, sneakerheads show their collections, sell or exchange sneakers, and attend public talks with designers and collectors. Typical example of online activity is making unboxing videos or video reviews of new sneakers where sneakerheads share their ideas and thoughts",4,1,5,1
45,what guitar did joe walsh play?,I don't know the specific model of guitar Joe Walsh played throughout his career.,Fender Stratocaster,"Joseph Fidler Walsh (born Joseph Woodward Fidler; November 20, 1947) is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Best known as a member of the rock band Eagles, his five-decade career includes solo work and stints in other bands: James Gang, Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band, and New Zealand's Herbs. He was part of the supergroup The Best and had success as a solo artist and prolific session musician, appearing on other artists' recordings. In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked him No. 54 on its list of ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"". In the mid-1960s, after attending Kent State University, Walsh played with several local Ohio bands before reaching national fame with the James Gang, whose hit ""Funk #49"" showcased his skills. Roger Abramson signed the James Gang to BPI in Cleveland. After leaving the James Gang in 1972, Walsh formed Barnstorm with Joe Vitale and Kenny Passarelli. Though the band produced three albums, their work was marketed as Walsh solo projects. The last Barnstorm album, So What (1974), featured significant contributions from Eagles members. At producer Bill Szymczyk's suggestion, Walsh joined the Eagles in 1975 as guitarist and keyboardist, replacing founding member Bernie Leadon. His first album with them was Hotel California. In 1998, a Guitarist magazine reader's poll named the solos by Walsh and Don Felder on ""Hotel California"" the best guitar solos ever. Guitar World ranked it eighth in the Top 100 Guitar Solos. As a member of the Eagles, Walsh was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001. The Eagles are one of the most influential bands of the 1970s and remain one of the best-selling American bands in history. Walsh's contributions to music have been praised by rock legends like Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, and Pete Townshend. Walsh has released 12 solo studio albums, six compilation albums, and two live albums. His solo hits include ""Rocky Mountain Way"", ""Life's Been Good"", ""All Night Long"", ""A Life of Illusion"", and ""Ordinary Average Guy"". == Early life and education == Walsh was born on November 20, 1947, in Wichita, Kansas. His father, Lt. Robert Newton Fidler, was a pilot for the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star in the United States Air Force and died in a plane crash in Okinawa on July 22, 1949. Walsh's mother, Helen, was a classically trained pianist of Scottish and German ancestry. Walsh was adopted by his stepfather at the age of five and given his stepfather's surname, but retained Fidler as his middle name. In the 1950s, it was common practice for children to take the name of their stepfather for Social Security, school registration, and health records. Walsh and his family lived in Columbus, Ohio, for a number of years during his youth. When he was twelve, his family moved to New York City. Later, Walsh moved to Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School, where he played oboe in the school band. Walsh acquired his first guitar at the age of 10, and upon learning the Ventures' ""Walk Don't Run"", decided that he wanted to pursue a career as a guitarist. Inspired by the success of the Beatles, he replaced Bruce Hoffman as the bass player in the locally popular group the Nomads in Madison, New Jersey, beginning his career as a rock musician. After high school, Walsh briefly attended Kent State University, where he spent time in various bands playing around the Cleveland, Ohio, area, including the Measles. The Measles recorded for Super K Productions' Ohio Express the songs ""I Find I Think of You"", ""And It's True"", and ""Maybe"" (an instrumental version of ""And It's True""). He planned to major in English and minor in music. Walsh has also stated he was present during the Kent State massacre in 1970. Walsh commented in 2012: ""Being at the shootings really affected me profoundly. I decided that maybe I don't need a degree that bad."" After one term, he dropped out of college to pursue his musical career. == Musical career == === 1

James Gang was an American rock band formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1966. The band went through a variety of line-up changes until they recorded their first album as a power trio consisting of Joe Walsh (guitars, lead vocals), Tom Kriss (bass) and Jim Fox (drums). Dale Peters replaced Kriss on bass for the band's second and third albums. Two of the band's songs, ""Funk #49"" and ""Walk Away"", continue to be popular on classic rock and AOR stations. In late 1971, Walsh left to pursue a solo career and would later join the Eagles. The band carried on with a number of other guitarists and lead singers to replace Walsh. However, after failing to produce a hit song over the course of six more studio albums, the band finally broke up in 1977. Walsh, Fox and Peters have reformed for reunions since then, including September 3, 2022, when the power trio returned for a performance at the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert held in Wembley Stadium. == History == === Early years === Drummer Jim Fox first played with the Cleveland-area band the Outsiders but left them in 1965 to attend college. After they had a national hit the following year with ""Time Won't Let Me"", Fox returned temporarily to play with them after their drummer was drafted. After leaving them again to return to school, Fox, heavily influenced by the sound of British Invasion bands such as the Beatles, the Who and the Yardbirds, began to think about forming his own band and teamed up with schoolmate Ronnie Silverman (guitar), bassist Tom Kriss and keyboardist Phil Giallombardo in 1966. The James Gang's earliest lineup consisted of Fox (drums), Kriss (bass), Silverman (guitar), Giallombardo (vocals, keyboards), and after auditioning some 25 candidates for lead guitar, the band decided to go with Greg Grandillo, who later played with another popular Cleveland band, Rainbow Canyon. He was soon replaced by Dennis Chandler, who was then succeeded by John ""Mouse"" Michalski who, with the Count Five, had just enjoyed a national hit with ""Psychotic Reaction"". A short time later, Fox was invited to audition for a nine-piece rhythm and blues band that was being assembled. Fox initially declined the offer but changed his mind when he heard that local guitar legend Glenn Schwartz, who was fresh out of the army, was to be in attendance. After hearing Schwartz play, and hearing that two of his influences were the Spencer Davis Group and Jeff Beck, Fox was impressed and invited Schwartz to join the James Gang. However, Michalski was not as enthused by Glenn's playing as Fox and left the band immediately. Ronnie Silverman soon departed as well to enter the military. Bill Jeric was then brought in to play alongside Schwartz. No recordings were ever released by these early lineups of the band. Around Christmastime of 1967, Schwartz, who was found to be AWOL from the army and was breaking up with his wife, decided to leave the band and move to California, where he ended up forming the band Pacific Gas & Electric. === Joe Walsh years === Just days later, shortly after the new year of 1968, a friend of Schwartz's, Joe Walsh (from a band called The Measles), knocked on Fox's door and asked to be given a tryout as Glenn's replacement. Walsh was accepted and the band continued as a five piece for a short time until Giallombardo, who was still in high school at the time, left. Jeric and Walsh worked together on guitar parts, but in the spring of 1968, Jeric ended up leaving as well. He was replaced by a returning Ronnie Silverman, who had been discharged from the military. On Sunday June 9, 1968 the group played a concert in Detroit at the Grande Ballroom opening for Cream. At the last minute, Silverman informed the others that he would not be joining them at the show. The band, desperately in need of the money, took to the stage as a trio. They liked their sound as a threesome and decided to remain that way. In 1968 the band signed with manager Mark Barger, who was handling the career of a fellow Ohi",1,1,1,5

Chick Hicks is the main villain who tries to overthrow Radiator Springs with the Chick Hicks Racing Academy, and introduces the player to three more of his protoges, Candice, El Machismo, and Stinger. He only competes in the Story Mode in a modified alternative, both his default and modified appearance are playable. He also heads his Students and VINs. Chick Hicks returns as a playable character. He is now retired and has his own talk show called ""Chick's Picks"" where at the end of an event, he talks about a certain character whether the player is playing as them or not. He usually always promotes himself, and also has some other playable characters show up and speak. The main menu is set where Chick talks, and he usually is seen, and when he's absent, his Pitties will put a cut-out where would supposedly be. He can be seen as the new retired racer coming back to race, like Doc and King in Cars: The Video Game. Stats Cars: The Video Game Livery Chick is green with sponsors for Hostile Takeover Bank and the number 86. A total of 334 stickers cloak his body and windows. In Cars 3, he has been touched up with Racing Sports Episode sponsors on his back sides and ""Chick Hicks 86"" on his hood. All HTB Logos have also now been removed. Paint Jobs Cars: The Video Game He as a red, blue, and white paint job with much less stickers, along with gray and orange or red variants (2,500 points each) A paintjob with ""football"" designs (Most expensive paintjob in the game, 5,000 points) (all four of these paintjobs later returned in Cars: Race-O-Rama) Cars: The Video Game PSP Red, Blue, and Orange recolors of his normal Skin. Cars: Fast as Lightning ""Purple Rage"", a pink version of his default skin ""Dinoco"", the paintjob he appears with in Lightning's daymare in the 2006 Cars movie Personality Chick is extremely rude and selfish, and tends to wreck any car who tries to beat him, as others call it cheating. He has even went as far as to overthrow Radiator Springs. After he retired sometime between Cars 2: The Video Game and Cars 3, he began to call himself ""Former and Forever Piston Cup Champion"". Abilities Chick Hicks is an extremely skilled Piston Cup Racer, constantly placing in the top five (although apart from Lightning, he also usually loses to one of Lee Jr, Hollister, Guenther, or Aikens). In Race-O-Rama, his modified form tended to have the worst boosting in the game on his poor side. Chick also has various special moves (called ""cheating"" by Lightning), and runs an academy where he teaches these to other cars.

According to the files of the game, Chick was originally gonna be named ""Chick Murphy"" which was also the case for the movie. This was likely changed due to another NASCAR related movie being made by Disney called: Herbie Fully Loaded, which released a year prior to Cars. Where the antagonist of the film was similarly named ""Trip Murphy"". Oddly enough, Michael Keaton is also in Herbie Fully Loaded as well as Cars. In the cut scene of Palm Mile Speedway, various depictions of him appear while Darrell Cartrip is talking about him and Lightning. The shots of Chick incorrectly have blue eyes. In the first game, Chick is shown to cheat in the cut scenes, but he never does in gameplay. Even though when being played as, the player can always bash around foes like he typically would. Los Angeles International Speedway is the only Piston Cup Race where Chick Hicks is the fastest car, in all other races, one of Lee Jr, Hollister, Guenther, or Aikens outspeeds him. (Although not supposed, he still sometimes loses to Lee Jr, Suregrip, and/or Hollister in this race) Because Chick Hicks appears in all Ornament Valley races after Ornament Valley Circuit, Lenny disappears from them, and the relationship between the two can be questioned. In the first game, Chick is the game's technical ""competitive play"" character, as he has much better performance than any other car. But as a fair price, he is much harder to handle. In Cars: The Video Game PSP, Chick Hicks is referred to as just ""Chick"" instead of his full name. Just how Lightning McQueen is simply referred to as ""Lightning"" in the main console versions of the game. Chick and Fillmore are tied with the most voice actors at 3. (4 if you count the Cars 3 movie where he is voiced by Bob Peterson. Which gives him the most voice actors overall.)",5,1,5,1
47,what is the government of france for 2010?,Legislative,Constitutional republic,"Vichy France (French: Régime de Vichy; 10 July 1940 – 9 August 1944), officially the French State (État français), was a French rump state headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain during World War II, established after the French capitulation after the defeat against Germany. It was named after its seat of government, the city of Vichy. Officially independent, but with half of its territory occupied under the harsh terms of the 1940 armistice with Nazi Germany, it adopted a policy of collaboration. Though Paris was nominally its capital, the government established itself in the resort town of Vichy in the unoccupied ""free zone"" (zone libre), where it remained responsible for the civil administration of France as well as its colonies. The occupation of France by Germany at first affected only the northern and western portions of the country. In November 1942, the Allies occupied the French North Africa, and in response the Germans and Italians occupied the entire Metropolitan France, ending any pretence of independence by the Vichy government. The Third French Republic had begun the war in September 1939 on the side of the Allies. On 10 May 1940, it was invaded by Nazi Germany. The German Army rapidly broke through the Allied lines by bypassing the highly fortified Maginot Line and invading through Belgium, Luxembourg, and as an extension, the Ardennes. By mid-June, the military situation of the French was dire, and it was apparent that it would lose the battle for Metropolitan France. The French government began to discuss the possibility of an armistice. Paul Reynaud resigned as prime minister rather than sign an armistice, and was replaced by Marshal Philippe Pétain, a hero of World War I. Shortly thereafter, Pétain signed the Armistice of 22 June 1940. At Vichy, Pétain established an authoritarian government that reversed many liberal policies and began tight supervision of the economy. Conservative Catholics became prominent. The media were tightly controlled and promoted antisemitism and, after Operation Barbarossa started in June 1941, anti-Sovietism. The terms of the armistice allowed some degree of independence, France was officially declared a neutral country, and the Vichy government kept the French Navy and French colonial empire under French control, avoiding full occupation of the country by Germany. Despite heavy pressure, the Vichy government never joined the Axis powers. In October 1940, during a meeting with Adolf Hitler in Montoire sur le Loire, Petain officially announced the policy of collaboration with Germany while maintaining overall neutrality in the war, believing that improving relations with Germany would have been the only viable option to save France and preserve for it a dignified place within the context of New European Order shaped by the victorious Germany. The Vichy government believed that with its policy of collaboration, it could have extracted significant concessions from Germany and avoid harsh terms in the peace treaty. Germany kept two million French prisoners-of-war and imposed forced labour (service du travail obligatoire) on young Frenchmen. The Vichy government tried to negotiate with Germany for the early release of the French prisoners of war. French soldiers were kept hostage to ensure that Vichy would reduce its military forces and pay a heavy tribute in gold, food, and supplies to Germany. French police were ordered to round up Jews and other ""undesirables"" such as communists and political refugees, and at least 72,500 French Jews were killed in Nazi concentration camps. Most of the French public initially supported the regime, but opinion turned against the Vichy government and the occupying German forces as the war dragged on and living conditions in France worsened. Open opposition intensified as it became clear that Germany was losing the war. The French Resistance, working largely in concert with the London-based Free France movement, increased in strength over the course of the

Bligh resigns after election wipe-out Exiting Queensland Premier Anna Bligh and husband Greg Withers during a press conference in Parliament House in Brisbane, March 25, 2012, where Ms Bligh announced she was resigning from her position as a the member for South Brisbane following the Liberal National Party's landslide election win, taking 78 out of 89 seats. (AAP: Dan Peled) abc.net.au/news/anna-bligh-resigns-from-parliament/3911416 Link copied Anna Bligh has announced she is standing aside as leader of the Queensland Labor party and resigning from Parliament after leading her party to its worst electoral defeat. ""I will be standing aside as the leader of the Labor Party and further I will be resigning as the member for South Brisbane,"" she said. ""Queensland has voted to close my era in Queensland politics."" Labor was swept from government after 14 years, as a huge swing towards the LNP saw the ALP lose all but seven of its seats. Ms Bligh said the loss was a ""devastating defeat"" for the ALP, and she felt the party could not look to rebuild with her in the Parliament. ""This is much more than a loss for Labor - it is without doubt a devastating defeat. The task for Labor is not to be consumed by that heartbreak,"" she said. The loudness and clarity of the message sent by the people of Queensland is unmistakable, and in fairness to Queenslanders I don't think I should ignore it. ""The task is to recover, to rebuild, to renew and to be everything that this enduring party has been for more than a century. ""It is not a task I believe can be achieved with me at the head of the team or as part of the team."" During the campaign Ms Bligh had said she would stay as the Member for South Brisbane no matter the final result, but she now says the scale of the defeat meant she did not feel she could continue in Parliament. ""I apologise to the people for South Brisbane for any inconvenience and difficulty that my decision today will cause them,"" she said. ""But when I took on the responsibilities of leadership and premier, I took on broader responsibilities that today I believe I have to rise to. ""The loudness of and clarity of the message sent by the people of Queensland is unmistakable, and in fairness to Queenslanders I don't think I should ignore it."" Her resignation takes effect on March 30, meaning the by-election could be held on the same day as upcoming local government elections. New leader Loading... Her decision to resign paves the way for the ALP to place a new leader in the Parliament. The landslide win culled the next generation of Labor leaders, including nine ministers, and left Labor without an obvious contender for opposition leader. Earlier former Labor premier Peter Beattie said Ms Bligh needed to stand aside to make way for an opposition leader. ""I think at some point, not now, Anna will need to make way for a future leader to be put into South Brisbane,"" he said. Mr Beattie says former Bligh ministers Cameron Dick or Andrew Fraser should look to take over the leadership. ""Look, I think Cameron Dick is clearly an incredibly good performer, so is Andrew Fraser. One of those has to be, in my view, put into South Brisbane,"" he said. Mr Dick only narrowly lost his Greenslopes seat, and says he has not ruled out a return to politics in the future. ""I do think I've perhaps got more to give to Queensland. It's been an extraordinary privilege to serve over the last few years and I think I've been able to demonstrate that I've got some of the skills and attributes that could help our state in the future,"" he said. But the outgoing education minister suggested Annastacia Palaszczuk could lead the Labor Party, and says it is a matter for the remaining MPs. ""I work closely with Annastacia Palaszczuk, who's one of the minister's that's continuing in the Opposition now and I think those ministers who've had experience in government should play a significant role in the Opposition,"" he said. ""But ultimately I'm very much a supporter of the traditions and history of our party and it will ultimately be the state parliamentary party who'll make that decision."" Trailblazing figure Irrespective of whoever leads the party into what is likely to be a long period in opposition, Ms Bligh says today marks the end of her time in politics. ""I think Queensland has very decisively closed the chapter on Anna Bligh's era in Queensland politics,"" she said. ""I think my time in public life after more than two decades is well and truly behind me."" Her resignation brings to an end a state political career that spans the best part of two decades. Queensland has very decisively closed the chapter on Anna Bligh's era in politics... My time in public life after more than two decades is well and truly behind me. Ms Bligh's first foray into politics began during her university days, with her involvement in the Student Union and Women's Rights Collective. She later worked in a number of community organisations, including childcare services, neighbourhood centres, women's refuges and trade unions as well as in the Queensland Public Service. Ms Bligh was first elected to parliament at the 1995 election to the safe Labor seat of South Brisbane. She was promoted to the ministry following the election of the Beattie government in 1998 as minister for families, and became Queensland's first female education minister in 2001. Four years later, the retirement of then deputy premier and treasurer Terry Mackenroth forced a cabinet reshuffle that saw Ms Bligh promoted to the office of deputy premier. Mr Beattie publicly endorsed her as his replacement when he announced his retirement from politics in September 2007. Ms Bligh then led Labor to victory in the 2009 state election, becoming Australia's first elected female premier. 'Get to work' Loading... Shortly after Ms Bligh announced her resignation, premier-elect Campbell Newman held his own press conference. He again thanked Ms Bligh for her service and says the LNP will ""vigorously"" contest the South Brisbane seat. ""I thank her for her service to Queensland... I particularly again pay tribute to her fantastic leadership during Cyclone Yasi and the floods. She did do a tremendous job and she needs to always be remembered for that,"" Mr Newman said. Mr Newman says it is now time for his party to get to work. ""What I'll be asking all the new MPs to do is to get to work, firstly thanking the people that have supported them throughout this campaign... and we will have a party room meeting on Wednesday. ""I will then be giving them some further direction about how they should go forward. ""The big thing for them is to get going in their electorates... there is a lot of work to be done."" Mr Newman reiterated his thanks to Queenslanders and vowed to keep his promises. ""We thank Queenslanders for their votes, we will not let them down, we will keep our promises, this is a win for them and it will always be about them as long as I am the premier of this state."" He outlined some key goals for the state - to achieve a 4 per cent unemployment rate; to make cost of living savings; and to cut waste and inefficiency. He also announced Jeff Seeney will be Deputy Premier and the Minister for State Development, while Tim Nicholls will take on the Treasury and Trade portfolios.

The Chadian–Libyan War was a series of military campaigns in Chad between 1978 and 1987, fought between Libyan and allied Chadian forces against Chadian groups supported by France, with the occasional involvement of other foreign countries and factions. Libya had been involved in Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before Muammar Gaddafi's rise to power in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the Chadian Civil War to northern Chad in 1968. The conflict was marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980–1981 and 1983–1987. On all of these occasions, Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the French government, which intervened militarily to support the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986. The pattern of the war delineated itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed the bulk of the scouting and fighting. This pattern was radically changed in 1986, towards the end of the war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity never previously witnessed in Chad. This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now by the United States, Zaire and France with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in air and other firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict. Gaddafi initially intended to annex the Aouzou Strip, the northernmost part of Chad, which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period. In 1972 his goals became, in the evaluation of historian Mario Azevedo, the creation of a client state in Libya's ""underbelly"", an Islamic republic modelled after his Jamahiriya, that would maintain close ties with Libya, and secure his control over the Aouzou Strip; expulsion of the French from the region; and use of Chad as a base to expand his influence in Central Africa. == Background == === Occupation of the Aouzou Strip === Libyan involvement with Chad can be said to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between the two sides of the Chad–Libya border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies. All this changed with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in northern Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces. Though initially wary of the FROLINAT, Gaddafi had come to see by 1970 the organization as useful to his needs. With the support of Soviet bloc nations, particularly East Germany, he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding. On 27 August 1971 Chad accused Egypt and Libya of backing a coup against then-president François Tombalbaye by recently amnestied Chadians. On the day of the failed coup, Tombalbaye cut all diplomatic relations with Libya and Egypt, and invited all Libyan opposition groups to base themselves in Chad, and started laying claims t",1,1,1,1
48,what led to stalin rise in power?,Lenin's influence and support.,"In 1912, Lenin, who was forced to flee the country, chose him to serve on the first Central Committee of the Bolshevik party, which had now broken from the Social Democrats.","In the early 2000s, significant political changes took place in Russia with Vladimir Putin's rise to power. He previously held key positions in security forces and government, and he became the successor to President Boris Yeltsin. After serving as the head of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation and as Secretary of the Security Council in August 1999, Putin became the head of the government. On 31 December 1999, following the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin, he was appointed Acting President. He was first elected President of Russia on 26 March 2000, and then re-elected in 2004, 2012, 2018, and 2024. == Situation in Russia == The political situation in Russia in the late 1990s was characterized by social and economic instability, a rise in crime, and the weakening of state institutions both domestically and internationally. President Boris Yeltsin suffered from health problems and alcoholism. He was not eligible to run for a third term according to the Russian constitution. Yeltsin remained energetic and focused in the face of emerging problems, but when it came to the strategic development of the state, he lacked a specific plan. There was also a growing sense of separatist sentiment in the country, especially in Chechnya, where the conflict remained unresolved. The 1998 financial crisis posed a serious challenge to Russia. Against the backdrop of the upcoming 2000 presidential elections, the political situation remained tense and uncertain. Russia had already experienced limitations on political competition during the 1996 elections. Yeltsin's health problems also weakened his influence. His daughter and son-in-law established schemes to enrich themselves and those close to the oligarchic family. With an impending change of power in the country, Yeltsin's family and the oligarchs feared for their finances and security, preferring to retain their power and influence. After the 1998 crisis, there were no longer advocates for democracy within Yeltsin's circle, and in 1999, those in power did not want, but rather sought the ability to choose Yeltsin's successor themselves. There was a growing demand for strengthening state power from society. Yeltsin did not see Yevgeny Primakov, who had led the government since 1998, as his successor because he was too closely associated with Gorbachev and the Soviet era. This situation created uncertainty on the eve of the transition to new leadership in the country. == Operation ""Successor"" == Operation ""Successor"" was a strategic plan developed by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his inner circle to prepare a successor for the presidency. A distinctive feature of this operation was the lack of broad public involvement in choosing the successor, which led to a halt in democratic development in the country. Yeltsin was inspired by the ideals of American President George Washington, particularly his democratic principles. Yeltsin echoed some of his democratic decisions, particularly distancing himself from any Russian political party. However, unlike Washington, who allowed Americans to freely choose their new leader upon his departure, Yeltsin chose a path that halted Russia's democratic development. Instead of ensuring free elections, Yeltsin considered it his right and duty to choose his successor. His strategy was to prepare and introduce his successor into the political arena without diminishing his own influence on Russia's political stage. This approach was focused on maintaining stability and strengthening personal power. This strategic decision by Yeltsin demonstrates his desire to maintain control over the political situation in Russia and ensure political protection for himself and his inner circle after stepping down as president. The idea of the need to prepare a successor emerged within Yeltsin's circle immediately after the 1996 presidential elections, and Yeltsin himself became involved in this after the 1998 economic crisis.

When was Joseph Stalin born? Joseph Stalin was born on December 18, 1878. His birth date was traditionally believed to be December 21, 1879, but the 1878 date was confirmed by records in the Communist Party central archives. When did Joseph Stalin die? Joseph Stalin died on March 5, 1953, in Moscow. His death triggered a leadership scramble within the Soviet Communist Party, and Nikita Khrushchev ultimately emerged as Stalin's successor. What was Joseph Stalin's childhood like? Joseph Stalin was raised in poverty in provincial Georgia. A bout of childhood smallpox scarred his face, and his left arm was mangled, most likely in a carriage accident. Although his mother doted on him, Stalin's father was a drunk who routinely beat him. Where was Joseph Stalin educated? Joseph Stalin learned Russian at the church school in his hometown of Gori, Georgia. He entered Tiflis Theological Seminary to train as a priest, but he left school in 1899. He never earned a degree. How did Joseph Stalin change the world? From 1928 until his death in 1953, Joseph Stalin ruled the Soviet Union as a dictator, transforming the country from an agrarian peasant society into a global superpower. The cost was tremendous, however: Stalin was responsible for the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens. During the quarter of a century preceding his death, the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin probably exercised greater political power than any other figure in history. Stalin industrialized the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, forcibly collectivized its agriculture, consolidated his position by intensive police terror, helped to defeat Germany in 1941-45, and extended Soviet controls to include a belt of eastern European states. Chief architect of Soviet totalitarianism and a skilled but phenomenally ruthless organizer, he destroyed the remnants of individual freedom and failed to promote individual prosperity, yet he created a mighty military-industrial complex and led the Soviet Union into the nuclear age. GoriMonument of Joseph Stalin in front of the town hall in Gori, Georgia. Stalin's biography was long obscured by a mendacious Soviet-propagated ""legend"" exaggerating his prowess as a heroic Bolshevik boy-conspirator and faithful follower of Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union. In his prime, Stalin was hailed as a universal genius, as a ""shining sun,"" or ""the staff of life,"" and also as a ""great teacher and friend"" (especially of those communities he most savagely persecuted); once he was even publicly invoked as ""Our Father"" by a metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church. Achieving wide visual promotion through busts, statues, and icons of himself, the dictator became the object of a fanatical cult that, in private, he probably regarded with cynicism. Early years Stalin was of Georgian--not Russian--origin, and persistent rumours claim that he was Ossetian on the paternal side. He was the son of a poor cobbler in the provincial Georgian town of Gori in the Caucasus, then an imperial Russian colony. The drunken father savagely beat his son. Speaking only Georgian at home, Joseph learned Russian--which he always spoke with a guttural Georgian accent--while attending the church school at Gori (1888-94). He then moved to the Tiflis Theological Seminary, where he secretly read Karl Marx, the chief theoretician of international Communism, and other forbidden texts, being expelled in 1899 for revolutionary activity, according to the ""legend""--or leaving because of ill health, according to his doting mother. The mother, a devout washerwoman, had dreamed of her son becoming a priest, but Joseph Dzhugashvili was more ruffianly than clerical in appearance and outlook. He was short, stocky, black-haired, fierce-eyed, with one arm longer than the other, his swarthy face scarred by smallpox contracted in infancy. Physically strong and endowed with prodigious willpower, he early learned to disguise his true feelings and to bide his time; in accordance with the Caucasian blood-feud tradition, he was implacable in plotting long-term revenge against those who offended him. In December 1899, Dzhugashvili became, briefly, a clerk in the Tiflis Observatory, the only paid employment that he is recorded as having taken outside politics; there is no record of his ever having done manual labour. In 1900 he joined the political underground, fomenting labour demonstrations and strikes in the main industrial centres of the Caucasus, but his excessive zeal in pushing duped workers into bloody clashes with the police antagonized his fellow conspirators. After the Social Democrats (Marxist revolutionaries) of the Russian Empire had split into their two competing wings--Menshevik and Bolshevik--in 1903, Dzhugashvili joined the second, more militant, of these factions and became a disciple of its leader, Lenin. Between April 1902 and March 1913, Dzhugashvili was seven times arrested for revolutionary activity, undergoing repeated imprisonment and exile. The mildness of the sentences and the ease with which the young conspirator effected his frequent escapes lend colour to the unproved speculation that Dzhugashvili was for a time an agent provocateur in the pay of the imperial political police. Stalin's rise to power Dzhugashvili made slow progress in the party hierarchy. He attended three policy-making conclaves of the Russian Social Democrats--in Tammerfors (now Tampere, Finland; 1905), Stockholm (1906), and London (1907)--without making much impression. But he was active behind the scenes, helping to plot a spectacular holdup in Tiflis (now Tbilisi) on June 25 (June 12, Old Style), 1907, in order to ""expropriate"" funds for the party. His first big political promotion came in February (January, Old Style) 1912, when Lenin--now in emigration--co-opted him to serve on the first Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party, which had finally broken with the other Social Democrats. In the following year, Dzhugashvili published, at Lenin's behest, an important article on Marxism and the national question. By now he had adopted the name Stalin, deriving from Russian stal (""steel""); he also briefly edited the newly founded Bolshevik newspaper Pravda before undergoing his longest period of exile: in Siberia from July 1913 to March 1917. In about 1904 Stalin had married a pious Georgian girl, Ekaterina Svanidze. She died some three years later and left a son, Jacob, whom his father treated with contempt, calling him a weakling after an unsuccessful suicide attempt in the late 1920s; when Jacob was taken prisoner by the Germans during World War II, Stalin refused a German offer to exchange his son. Reaching Petrograd from Siberia on March 25 (March 12, Old Style), 1917, Stalin resumed editorship of Pravda. He briefly advocated Bolshevik cooperation with the provisional government of middle-class liberals that had succeeded to uneasy power on the last tsar's abdication during the February Revolution. But under Lenin's influence, Stalin soon switched to the more-militant policy of armed seizure of power by the Bolsheviks. When their coup d'etat occurred in November (October, Old Style) 1917, he played an important role, but one less prominent than that of his chief rival, Leon Trotsky. Active as a politico-military leader on various fronts during the Civil War of 1918-20, Stalin also held two ministerial posts in the new Bolshevik government, being commissar for nationalities (1917-23) and for state control (or workers' and peasants' inspection; 1919-23). But it was his position as secretary general of the party's Central Committee, from 1922 until his death, that provided the power base for his dictatorship. Besides heading the secretariat, he was also member of the powerful Politburo and of many other interlocking and overlapping committees--an arch-bureaucrat engaged in quietly outmaneuvering brilliant rivals, including Trotsky and Grigory Zinovyev, who despised such mundane organizational work. Because the pockmarked Georgian was so obviously unintellectual, they thought him unintelligent--a gross error, and one literally fatal in their case. From 1921 onward Stalin flouted the ailing Lenin's wishes, until, a year before his death, Lenin wrote a political ""testament,"" since widely publicized, calling for Stalin's removal from the secretary generalship; coming from Lenin, this document was potentially ruinous to Stalin's career, but his usual luck and skill enabled him to have it discounted during his lifetime.",1,1,5,1
49,who wrote st trinians?,Ronald Searle originally created the characters and settings for St Trinian's. The 2007 film adaptation was written by Jeff Nathanson.,Ronald Searle,"St Trinian's is a 2007 British comedy film and the sixth in a long-running series of British films based on the works of cartoonist Ronald Searle and set in St Trinian's School. The first five films form a series, starting with The Belles of St. Trinian's in 1954, with sequels in 1957, 1960, 1966 and a reboot in 1980. The release of 2007, 27 years after the last entry, and 53 years after the first film, is a rebooting of the franchise, rather than a direct sequel, with certain plot elements borrowed from the first film. Whereas the earlier films concentrated on the adults, this film gives the school pupils greater prominence. St Trinian's is an anarchic school for uncontrollable girls run by eccentric headmistress Camilla Dagey Fritton (the reboot continues the tradition, established by Alastair Sim in the original film, of casting a male actor to play the female headmistress, with Rupert Everett inheriting the role). St Trinian's received mixed reviews but remains one of the highest-grossing British independent films of the last thirty years. == Plot == Annabelle Fritton, an uptight daddy's girl, unwillingly transfers to St Trinian's from the distinguished Cheltenham Ladies' College at the request of her father, Carnaby Fritton. Annabelle is resentful and insulting, telling her father that the school is ""like Hogwarts for pikeys"". She is taken around the school by Kelly Jones, the head girl, who introduces her to the various cliques within the school; Chavs, Posh Totty, Geeks, Emo and First Years. Annabelle is harassed and pranked by the girls while in the shower and a video of her running around the school naked and wet is broadcast live on the internet. After a phone argument with her father she is drafted to the hockey team when she hits her phone with her hockey stick, smashing a statue. The girls of St Trinian's are involved in business with spiv Flash Harry, who pays them to make cheap vodka. Flash is shown to be romantically interested in Kelly, who initially turns him down. The Cheltenham Ladies' College hockey team arrive at St Trinian's, along with Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites. Thwaites is shown to have romantic history with the headmistress of St Trinian's, Camilla Fritton. Annabelle is forced to face her former bullies, including captain Verity Thwaites. The hockey match is violent, ending in Kelly shooting a winning goal for St Trinian's, and she begins to fit in with the other girls. As the match is being played, Thwaites inspects the school, finding the illegal vodka-making business and the chatline being run by the Posh Totty clique. The following morning, a banker arrives at the school and serves Camilla with a foreclosure notice, as the school owes the bank in excess of £500,000 and has ignored six previous final demands. A subsequent meeting between Camilla and Carnaby is watched by the girls using hidden cameras, in which Carnaby confesses his distaste towards his daughter. Annabelle is clearly upset, despite Camilla defending her. Carnaby encourages Camilla to turn the school into a boutique hotel, telling her that ""when this school closes down, you'll have lost everything. More importantly, so will I."" Kelly and Flash work with the students to devise a plan to save the school. They must get into the final of School Challenge, a TV quiz show held in the National Gallery in London, as a cover for stealing Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring. Chelsea, Peaches and Chloe (the Posh Totty clique) are chosen as the School Challenge Team. By cheating in every round, they make it to the grand final. As the final is being filmed, Kelly, Taylor and Andrea steal the painting, with help from the Geeks, Annabelle and Camilla herself. Camilla paints an exact copy of the painting and has Flash, posing as a German art dealer, sell it to Carnaby in a black market deal. The school then receives a further £50,000 reward for returning the real painting to the National Gallery. The loans are able to be repaid and the

Theodor Seuss Geisel ( sooss GHY-zəl, zoyss -⁠; March 2, 1904 – September 24, 1991) was an American children's author and cartoonist. He is known for his work writing and illustrating more than 60 books under the pen name Dr. Seuss ( sooss, zooss). His work includes many of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death. Geisel adopted the name ""Dr. Seuss"" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and as a graduate student at Lincoln College, Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, including for FLIT and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper PM. He published his first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street in 1937. During World War II, he took a brief hiatus from children's literature to illustrate political cartoons, and he worked in the animation and film department of the United States Army. After the war, Geisel returned to writing children's books, writing acclaimed works such as If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), Green Eggs and Ham (1960), One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish (1960), The Sneetches and Other Stories (1961), The Lorax (1971), The Butter Battle Book (1984), and Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990). He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including eleven television specials, five feature films, a Broadway musical, and four television series. He received two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children's Special for Halloween Is Grinch Night (1978) and Outstanding Animated Program for The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat (1982). In 1984, he won a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation. His birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an initiative focused on reading created by the National Education Association. == Life and career == === Early years === Geisel was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in his first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is near his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. The family was of Jewish descent. Geisel was raised as a Missouri Synod Lutheran and remained in the denomination his entire life. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925. At Dartmouth, he joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the humor magazine Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief. While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room. At the time, the possession and consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the Jack-O-Lantern. To continue working on the magazine without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name ""Seuss"". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his ""big inspiration for writing"" at Dartmouth. Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.) in English literature. At Oxford, he met his future wife Helen Palmer, who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career. She later recalled that ""Ted's notebooks were always fil",2,1,5,1

Morrison played for three years at Gonzaga University and was considered to be one of the top college basketball players in 2005–06. He was a finalist for the Naismith and the Wooden Award. He was named Co-Player of the Year with Duke's JJ Redick by the United States Basketball Writers Association and won the 2006 Chevrolet Player of the Year award. He played for the Charlotte Bobcats from 2006 to 2009, and for the L.A. Lakers from 2009 to 2010, where he won two NBA Championships. == Early life == Morrison's father, John, worked as a basketball coach, and the family moved with his coaching career: Casper College in Casper, Wyoming, Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota, and Dawson Community College in Glendive, Montana. When Morrison was in the fourth grade, his father left coaching, and the family moved to Spokane, Washington. Adam became the Gonzaga men's team's ball boy. When he was in the eighth grade, he lost 30 pounds (14 kg), and while attending a basketball camp at Gonzaga during this time, he felt sick, later saying about his experience at the camp, ""I think I made one shot the whole three days. I was sicker than a dog. I didn't want to play. I couldn't do anything."" Shortly after this, Morrison was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. He took his diagnosis surprisingly well; the second time a nurse came to administer insulin, he stopped her, telling her, ""Since I'm going to be doing this the rest of my life, you might as well show me how to do it."" However, his illness did not keep him from becoming a star at Mead Senior High School in Spokane. In his senior year he broke single-season and career scoring records in his high school conference, and led Mead to the finals of the state tournament. Despite playing in the final game with hypoglycemia so severe that he nearly had a seizure, he scored 37 points in a losing effort. It was Mead's only loss that season. Morrison was not heavily recruited out of high school. Dave Telep of scout.com admitted, ""In one of the biggest misses of my career, we left him off the Top 100 list. We ranked him the No. 26 small forward. The goal is to never make a mistake of that magnitude again"". == College career == Morrison arrived at Gonzaga University to play for the Gonzaga Bulldogs in 2003. In his freshman year he averaged 11.4 points per game (ppg), with a season-high 22 points against St. Mary's. Gonzaga won the West Coast Conference (WCC) regular-season title. Morrison was named to the WCC All-Freshman Team. In his sophomore year Morrison averaged 19.0 ppg. He scored a season-high 28 points at home against San Francisco, including the winning shot with 0.6 seconds to play in the game. Gonzaga again won the WCC regular-season title. Morrison made the All-WCC First Team and was selected to the Basketball Times All-West Coast Team as well as being named an honorable mention Associated Press All-American. In his junior year during Gonzaga's first two games of the 2005–06 season at the Maui Invitational, Morrison played well against two of the sport's top programs. In the first round, Morrison scored 25 points in a Gonzaga win over Maryland. He followed up this performance with 43 points in a triple-overtime win over Michigan State in the semifinals. He matched that output against in-state rival Washington on December 4, 2005, in a losing effort. However, Morrison and the Zags bounced back a week later, defeating Oklahoma State after he banked in a three-pointer with 2.5 seconds left to give Gonzaga a two-point lead and eventually the win. In the regular season, he had 13 games of 30-plus points, with five of them over 40. At 28.1 points per game, he was the nation's leading scorer in 2005–2006. His scoring totals against teams in the ""major"" conferences were no less impressive; he averaged 28.5 points in 11 such games. On February 18, Morrison recorded a career high 44 points (in

There are a lot of things to enjoy about Florida State University baseball. Part of the fun is watching a number of the young players develop their skills at FSU and then go on to play professional baseball. It is a special treat when they become very successful and make it to baseball's major leagues. Some have even become stars at that lofty level. Such has been the case with former Seminoles Dick Howser, Woody Woodward, Terry Kennedy, Jody Reed, and J.D. Drew, to name but a few. Nowadays, we have another of those special treats in being able to follow the career of Buster Posey. Buster Posey Posey's baseball development is a most interesting and unusual story. In the little town of Leesburg, just north of Albany, Georgia, he was an excellent high school shortstop who also pitched. In 2004, he was a member of the USA Junior Olympic team and started two games as a pitcher at the 2004 IBAF World Championships. He was good enough to be named Georgia's Gatorade Player of the Year in his senior year denoting him as the best Georgia high school player that season according to the award's selection committee. Out of high school he was drafted by the California Angels in 2005 but not until the 50th round. It would be interesting to know who the 49 guys were that the Angels drafted ahead of him. Fortunately for FSU he turned down California's invitation and chose instead to play for the Seminoles. As a shortstop for FSU in his freshman year, he was outstanding. He started all 65 games, was second on the team in hitting with a .346 average and was proclaimed a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American at the end of the season. As FSU prepared for the 2007 season, Assistant Coach Mike Martin, Jr., who had been a catcher for FSU as an undergraduate, saw something in Posey's skills that caused him to ask Posey to try playing catcher. It was a perfect fit. Almost immediately, Posey became one of the best catchers in college baseball. His batting improved to .382 and at the end of the year he was not only on the All ACC team but was a first team All-American by Collegiate Baseball. He also became the first college sophomore ever to be a finalist for the Johnny Bench Catcher's Award. There was no slowing down for Posey in the 2008 season. In his junior year, as team Captain, he batted .463, caught, was the team pitching closer, and led the team to the College World Series. When the dust had settled he had won about every award that can be given to a college player as the 2008 consensus national player of the year. As such he won the Brooks Wallace Award, the Dick Howser Trophy, and the Golden Spikes Award, each of which recognizes a national player of the year as well as the Johnny Bench Award as the Best Catcher. When the baseball draft came this time, he was the San Francisco Giants' first pick (fifth overall). When he eventually signed a contract, he got a $6.2 million bonus, which at the time was the highest bonus ever paid upfront by a major league team. In 2009, Posey's first year as a professional baseball player, he began in Class A Baseball with the San Jose Giants, but soon, in July was promoted to the Triple A Fresno Grizzlies and then in September was called up to the majors when the Giants' regular catcher was injured. Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. In 2010, he started the season back in Triple A with Fresno, but on May 29, 2010, he was back with the Giants' major league team. He started out primarily as a first baseman and backup catcher but when the regular first baseman was traded away in late June, Posey became the starting catcher for the Giants. What happened after that is most remarkable. With Posey leading the way, both at bat where he batted .305 and hit 18 home runs during the regular season, and as the catcher controlling the pitchers the Giants won their division. They went on to win the National League Championship and then became World Champs by defeating the Texas Rangers, four games to one in the World Series. At the end of it all, Posey won a plethora of awards including being named the National League Rookie of the Year. As the sixth Giant in history to win that award he joined the list that includes Willie Mays, Orlando Cepeda, Willie McCovey, Gary Matthews and John Montefusco. As I write this, the major league teams' spring training is in progress. The word I get is that Posey has picked up where he left off and is headed for another good season. I hope that is the case because there are lots of FSU fans that will be watching and cheering for him to do so. It will be a lot of fun following Buster Posey. I hope that it will be a long ride.

Standing Behind ""The Stache"": NBA's Adam Morrison At the 2006 NBA Draft, Adam dons his new team cap as his parents, Wanda and John Morrison, stand proudly by him. Miami, FL (November 2006) -- Wanda and John Morrison have mastered the art of teamwork. It's apparent in conversation as each finishes the other's last sentence. Maybe it stems from a solid foundation and 32 years of married life. Perhaps it ripened over time as they raised three children together, or sprung from necessity when their youngest was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Wherever it originated, this warm and loving couple has passed the asset along to their kids, and especially to their youngest child, Adam Morrison, 22. Selected by the Charlotte Bobcats as the third overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft, Adam has taken this team mentality to a whole new level, while overcoming the challenges of this disease. ""There are several professional athletes that play a variety of sports, and they have diabetes,"" said John of his son. ""I think being into athletics has actually helped Adam stay in control of this disease - the discipline, the practice, his work ethic, and tenacity. He refuses to lose."" Despite diabetes, Adam was the third overall pick in the NBA draft. As Adam is quickly rising to household name status, his parents look back upon his diagnosis, their family's strength and solidarity, and their commitment to their son and his future. A family history of diabetes... On May 2, 1999, the devastating news of Adam's diagnosis came as no surprise. Type 1 diabetes has affected both sides of the family and even the Morrisons' beloved dog, Megan, suffered with the disease. ""Diabetes is not the death sentence it was for my mother. The technology was nowhere near where it is today,"" said Wanda, who lost her mother to diabetes complications. John's grandfather also suffered with the disease and the loss of a limb. From a young age, Adam and their two daughters, Brandie, 28, and Sara, 25, were keenly aware that there was a family history of diabetes. ""We were never untruthful with our children."" The undeniable signs surfaced after their 14-year-old battled a bout with the flu. At the John R. Wooden Award Ceremony, Wanda and John pose with their son, who was one of the top ten Wooden All-Americans and one of five finalists for this prestigious award. ""I made him stay home from a tournament, which, to Adam, was worse than death. I really feel that incident is where his genes took a wrong turn,"" said Wanda of the illness. ""He lost weight, drank a lot of water, and was using the bathroom a lot. John and I could tell this wasn't going to be good."" A trip to the emergency room confirmed what they already knew in their hearts. ""He was such a trooper. He didn't even cry,"" Wanda insisted, but beyond the tough exterior, she could see that Adam's mind was reeling. She imagined that he was contemplating his life and future, the possible end to a career in sports, and even death. Talking about Megan helped make the moment a little lighter, however, it was Adam's doctor who extinguished his most inconceivable fear in an instant with just a few words, ""You can still play basketball."" The Morrisons watched the tension in their son's face drain - the diagnosis rendered bearable once he realized that he could continue to strive for his dream. ""There was no way we could discourage him after that,"" said Wanda. During the first few weeks after Adam's diagnosis, the Morrison family made the necessary changes to their lifestyle, eliminating the cookies from the cabinets and ice cream from the freezer. Since they were a healthy, athletic bunch, well-balanced meals were always on the menu, and fast food was never the norm. However, John described that first trip to the grocery store as rather intimidating. ""We were wondering where the diabetic section was. We were looking for low sugar this and that, checking out the carb counts. That part was nerve-wracking at first,"" he said. Wanda continued, ""In the beginning, and to this day, there's still some freaking out, the inevitable highs and lows, but we know that diabetes will not defeat us."" ""The biggest thing is to stay on task,"" John finished. Diabetes on the court... A basketball coach for more than 20 years, John introduced Adam to the game he now loves. Basketball games, bus rides and practices were always a part of the family's routine. John and Wanda recognized their son's talent early on when their toddler started shooting hoops at 13 months. ""He didn't like missing shots then either,"" Wanda joked. A prolific scorer, Adam averaged more than 25 points per game at Gonzaga University, located in his hometown of Spokane, WA. The 6-foot-8, 205-pound forward led the NCAA's Division-1 in scoring last season and was hailed West Coast Conference player of the year before announcing that he would forgo his senior year for the NBA. An aggressive competitor with a killer instinct and a wicked jump shot, Adam is adored by fans for his charismatic personality and that trademark patchy mustache that earned him the nickname, ""The Stache."" In college, he perfected his pre-game ritual to a science in order to keep his glucose levels under control. On game day, he eats the same meal two hours and 15 minutes before tip-off, using a pump through warm-up, disconnecting and taking insulin manually if necessary during the game, then hooking back up to the pump after the buzzer. ""Once we looked into the possibility of the pump and decided to move forward with it, it really was the best thing for Adam,"" said John. Adam has never hidden the fact that he has diabetes; however, like many teens with the disease, he wanted to avoid being labeled as ""different."" His mother recalled that he would typically head to the bathroom when he needed a shot of insulin at school, and on the court, the necessity turned into a nuisance. Wanda explained, ""He just didn't want to leave the game. It took a while for him to get used to it."" His devoted mom would sit directly behind the bench, assisting in glucose checks during time-outs and carrying an arsenal of insulin and snacks. Wanda remembered one heart-wrenching experience when as a high school junior Adam suffered a severe insulin reaction during a game. ""He said to me, 'Mom, there's only one thing that can stop me, and that's diabetes.' My heart ached,"" said Wanda. That moment was the impetus that led the family to a nutritionist, who provided them with a better understanding of how to control the disease and got Adam on the right track to an enormously successful career. ""Tough as it was, that was the trigger for getting Adam what he needed to excel."" Rising to star athlete... Despite the myriad accolades Adam received throughout college - plus the fact that he's a clutch performer who can get a shot off from anywhere - some teams might have considered his diabetes to be an insurmountable obstacle. However, after selecting Adam, it's clear that Michael Jordan, the new basketball operations chief and part owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, believes he has what it takes to outrival opposing defenses during the 82-game pro schedule. Adam's style of play has drawn comparisons to Larry Bird, and not so coincidentally, the Hall of Famer is Adam's favorite baller to have ever played the game. But it's comparisons to former NBA center Chris Dudley, who played with type 1 diabetes for 16 seasons, that has reminded many that diabetes does not equate to disability. Bulldog fans, on the other hand, have never doubted the ability and sheer performance value of The Stache. They have always relished the intensity he plays with and the animated persona that rears its head in trash-talking tongues - though Wanda insists that sharp remarks on the court are almost ""deceiving."" ""He's actually quite shy,"" she confided. ""But he's also a warrior, on the court and off. He'll do whatever it takes to win. That aspect of his personality comes out with his diabetes, too. He won't let anything interfere with his dreams."" For these reasons and more, Adam has set a strong example for his younger fans. ""Adam never set out to be a role model, but I think he's become a good one,"" Wanda proudly stated of her son, who happens to sign countless autographs but always takes extra time for kids with diabetes. ""When he was first diagnosed, Adam didn't really have a mentor with diabetes to look up to. That's why it's so important to him now - to be that person for others."" Advice for other parents... If Wanda and John can offer any advice to other families like theirs, it is to always encourage your children to chase their hopes and dreams, regardless of diabetes. ""We worry just like any other parents,"" said Wanda of the intense NBA schedule and the possibility of injury that all athletes face. ""That's our little boy out there. Having this disease might make a child's dreams harder to reach, but you can never give up hope,"" Wanda said, holding back tears. The payoff? ""Adam's dream has come true, and we are unbelievably proud of him,"" said Wanda. The future? ""A cure for diabetes is on the horizon, and we believe it will happen in his lifetime,"" she concluded. Scientists at the Diabetes Research Institute are working feverishly to ensure that Wanda and John's dream comes true, too.

Top Stories Michael Jordan's decision to sell Hornets leaves some team decisions in flux With the NBA's Board of Governors unlikely to approve the sale until at least another month, how should Charlotte approach the upcoming Draft and free agency period? Steve Reed | The Associated Press June 17, 2023 4:28 PM Michael Jordan plans to keep a minority stake in the Hornets, the team he bought in 2010 for about $275 million. CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The timing of Michael Jordan's decision to sell his majority ownership stake in the Charlotte Hornets has left the organization in flux, with several looming key personnel decisions. The Hornets have the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft on Thursday night. They also have some difficult decisions to make in free agency in early July, including whether to re-sign embattled restricted free-agent Miles Bridges. With the NBA's Board of Governors unlikely to approve the team's sale to an ownership group led by Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall until at least another month or two, the question becomes who'll sign off on general manager Mitch Kupchak's potentially franchise-altering decisions this summer? Will it be Jordan, a lame duck majority owner? Or will the new ownership have a major input? Jordan will remain on as a minority owner after the sale is approved, so he still has a vested interest in the organization. Bobby Marks, a front office insider for ESPN, said the timing of the announcement makes this a unique situation. ""Whether it's Mitch or Michael making the decisions, I think you have to keep these guys from the new ownership group in the loop,"" Marks said. ""... At the end of the day, they don't technically have a say in anything yet, but I would think they have to be part of the conversation, particularly when it comes to taking on future money."" But Marks said the trade rumors swirling around the New Orleans Pelicans potentially being open to moving former No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson in order to secure the second or third pick in the draft complicates things for the Hornets. Essentially, would a trade that has long-lasting implications sit well with new ownership? ""If they have a chance to move out of the two spot, what happens when you have salary involved that stretches past this year, which means money out of their pockets? I would think you would want to get (the new ownership group's) blessing before taking on money like that,"" Marks said. ESPN commentator Jeff Van Gundy agrees. ""I would suspect there would be conversations about who they want to draft and sign before anything is finalized,"" Van Gundy said. Both Marks and Van Gundy believe the toughest decision ahead involves whether or not to re-sign Bridges. A former first-round pick out of Michigan State, Bridges had a breakout season in 2021-22. He led the team in scoring and rebounding and appeared on the verge of a huge pay day last summer before felony domestic violence charges put his career on hold. The 25-year-old Bridges wound up pleading no contest to the charges and agreed to three years probation. He missed all of last season. The NBA ultimately determined Bridges will serve a 10-game suspension once he returns to the league. The league officially suspended him for 30 games, but determined 20 games of the suspension have already been served because Bridges already missed all 82 games in 2022-23. ""In terms of the new owners you have to wonder, is that what you want your first signing to be?"" Marks said. Added Van Gundy: ""There is more to that (decision) than just basketball."" Van Gundy believes the Hornets are in good hands in terms of personnel decisions with longtime NBA general manager Mitch Kupchak at the helm. He believes both Jordan and the new owners will rely heavily upon his opinion moving forward during this time of transition. As a player, Jordan was a six-time NBA Finals MVP, a 14-time All-Star and a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He's in the conversation as the greatest basketball player of all-time. But he never approached that level of success as an owner. The Hornets were 423-600 in his 13 years as majority owner and never won a playoff series. Charlotte has failed to reach the playoffs seven straight seasons, the longest drought in the NBA. Still, Van Gundy said he was surprised when reports first surfaced that Jordan was looking to sell the team. ""He always looked to be a hands-on owner,"" Van Gundy said. ""I know he has the fishing and the auto racing that he's involved in, but I still didn't expect him to get out of the NBA. And yet he looks like he is going to make a tidy profit, so good for him."" Jordan purchased the team for $275 million in 2010 and will sell it for a reported $3 billion. ""You win with Michael Jordan the player,"" Van Gundy added. ""Those type of players will make you elite for a long time. You see it with (Nikola) Jokic. It's hard to get those players, and when you do you are set up for a long period of time. ... But the Hornets, they missed on a few high draft picks."" After finishing 7-59 in the 2011-12 season, the Hornets failed to land the No. 1 pick in the lottery and missed out on star center Anthony Davis. Charlotte settled for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist at No. 2, passing on Bradley Beal and Damion Lillard. The Hornets also selected Cody Zeller fourth overall in 2013 instead over Giannis Antetokounmpo and Steven Adams, and swung and missed on top 10 picks Frank Kaminsky and Noah Vonleh in 2014 and 2015. ""It's about the roster, the roster, the roster,"" Van Gundy said. ""The most important person in every organization is the person who picks the players.""",1,1,1,1
51,where did kennedy's inaugural address take place?,"Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.",John F. Kennedy 1961 presidential inauguration,"On January 20, 1961, President John F. Kennedy delivered his inaugural address in which he announced that ""we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty."" The inaugural ceremony is a defining moment in a president's career -- and no one knew this better than John F. Kennedy as he prepared for his own inauguration on January 20, 1961. He wanted his address to be short and clear, devoid of any partisan rhetoric and focused on foreign policy. Kennedy began constructing his speech in late November, working from a speech file kept by his secretary and soliciting suggestions from friends and advisors. He wrote his thoughts in his nearly indecipherable longhand on a yellow legal pad. While his colleagues submitted ideas, the speech was distinctly the work of Kennedy himself. Aides recounted that every sentence was worked, reworked, and reduced. The meticulously crafted piece of oratory dramatically announced a generational change in the White House. It called on the nation to combat ""tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself"" and urged American citizens to participate in public service. The climax of the speech and its most memorable phrase - ""Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country"" - was honed down from a thought about sacrifice that Kennedy had long held in his mind and had expressed in various ways in campaign speeches. Less than six weeks after his inauguration, on March 1, President Kennedy issued an executive order establishing the Peace Corps as a pilot program within the Department of State. He envisioned the Peace Corps as a pool of trained American volunteers who would go overseas to help foreign countries meet their needs for skilled manpower. Later that year, Congress passed the Peace Corps Act, making the program permanent. Transcript We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom--symbolizing an end as well as a beginning--signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago. The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. This much we pledge--and more. To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder. To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside. To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich. To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge--to convert our good words into good deeds--in a new alliance for progress--to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house. To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support--to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective--to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak--and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run. Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction. We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course--both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war. So let us begin anew--remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate. Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us. Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms--and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations. Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce. Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah--to ""undo the heavy burdens . . . (and) let the oppressed go free."" And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved. All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin. In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe. Now the trumpet summons us again--not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need--not as a call to battle, though embattled we are-- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, ""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation""--a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself. Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort? In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility--I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it--and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man. Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.

52,where did the second battle of ypres occur?,Ypres,Belgium,"The First Battle of Ypres (French: Première Bataille des Flandres, German: Erste Flandernschlacht, 19 October – 22 November 1914) was a battle of the First World War, fought on the Western Front around Ypres, in West Flanders, Belgium. The battle was part of the First Battle of Flanders, in which German, French, Belgian armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fought from Arras in France to Nieuwpoort (Nieuport) on the Belgian coast, from 10 October to mid-November. The battles at Ypres began at the end of the Race to the Sea, reciprocal attempts by the German and Franco-British armies to advance past the northern flank of their opponents. North of Ypres, the fighting continued in the Battle of the Yser (16–31 October), between the German 4th Army, the Belgian army and French marines. The fighting has been divided into five stages, an encounter battle from 19 to 21 October, the Battle of Langemarck from 21 to 24 October, the battles at La Bassée and Armentières to 2 November, coincident with more Allied attacks at Ypres and the Battle of Gheluvelt (29–31 October), a fourth phase with the last big German offensive, which culminated at the Battle of Nonne Bosschen on 11 November, then local operations which faded out in late November. Brigadier-General James Edmonds, the British official historian, wrote in the History of the Great War, that the II Corps battle at La Bassée could be taken as separate but that the battles from Armentières to Messines and Ypres, were better understood as one battle in two parts, an offensive by III Corps and the Cavalry Corps from 12 to 18 October against which the Germans retired and an offensive by the German 6th Army and 4th Army from 19 October to 2 November, which from 30 October, took place mainly north of the Lys, when the battles of Armentières and Messines merged with the Battles of Ypres. Attacks by the BEF (Field Marshal Sir John French) the Belgians and the French Eighth Army in Belgium made little progress beyond Ypres. The German 4th and 6th Armies took small amounts of ground, at great cost to both sides, during the Battle of the Yser and further south at Ypres. General Erich von Falkenhayn, head of the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, the German General Staff), then tried a limited offensive to capture Ypres and Mont Kemmel (Kemmelberg), from 19 October to 22 November. Neither side had moved forces to Flanders fast enough to obtain a decisive victory and by November both sides were exhausted. The armies were short of ammunition, suffering from low morale and some infantry units refused orders. The autumn battles in Flanders had become static, attrition operations, unlike the battles of manoeuvre in the summer. French, British and Belgian troops, in improvised field defences, repulsed German attacks for four weeks. From 21 to 23 October, German reservists had made mass attacks at Langemarck (Langemark), with losses of up to 70 per cent, to little effect. Warfare between mass armies, equipped with the weapons of the Industrial Revolution and its later developments, proved to be indecisive, because field fortifications neutralised many classes of offensive weapon. The defensive firepower of artillery and machine guns dominated the battlefield and the ability of the armies to supply themselves and replace casualties prolonged battles for weeks. Thirty-four German divisions fought in the Flanders battles, against twelve French, nine British and six Belgian divisions, along with marines and dismounted cavalry. Over the winter, Falkenhayn reconsidered Germany strategy because Vernichtungsstrategie and the imposition of a dictated peace on France and Russia had exceeded German resources. Falkenhayn devised a new strategy to detach either Russia or France from the Allied coalition through diplomacy as well as military action. A strategy of attrition (Ermattungsstrategie) would make the cost of the war too great for the Allies, until one dropped out and made a separate peace. The remainin

News * Early settlement and growth Origins Although the region has been inhabited since prehistoric times, the oldest known reference to Brussels dates to the 10th century, when it had the Frankish name Bruocsella, which means ""settlement in the marshes."" The settlement at that time was a part of Lower Lotharingia, or Lower Lorraine, which later became known as the duchy of Brabant. Brussels owes its development to its location on the Senne (Flemish: Zenne) River, which flows from south to north, and an east-west economic route linking towns on the Rhine, such as Cologne (now in Germany), with Brugge (French: Bruges), Ieper (French: Ypres), and other towns in the county of Flanders. At the point where road and river crossed, a market and bartering place developed under the protection of the dukes of Brabant. By the 12th century, Brussels was surrounded by defensive ramparts with towers and fortified gateways. During the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries, Brussels grew to become one of the major towns of the duchy of Brabant. Its economic mainstay was the manufacture of luxury fabrics, which were exported to fairs in Paris, Venice, the Champagne region of France, and elsewhere. The cloth trade made fortunes for a few enterprising merchant families, who developed into seven dynasties that, with the help of the duke of Brabant, acquired a position of complete political mastery. In control of business and municipal affairs, they also exercised power as magistrates, giving rulings on disputes arising among the inhabitants, as well as acting as a court of appeal for neighbouring areas. The prevailing regime was, in fact, strongly plutocratic in nature. Abuse of such powers provoked violent popular uprisings in 1280, 1303, 1360, and 1421. This last upheaval led to a more equitable system of government, with local powers divided between the patrician families and the emergent guilds of craftsmen and other workers. Gradually, however, the patrician elite regained political control; as late as 1719 a popular revolt led by Frans Anneessens ended with his public execution. Centuries of occupation Events of particular significance in the 14th century were the invasion of the duchy of Brabant by troops of the count of Flanders, their brief occupation of Brussels, and the construction--immediately after the town's liberation--of huge fortified walls (1357-79), which survived until the first half of the 19th century. In 1430 the duchy was merged with the possessions of the duke of Burgundy. The Burgundian period, which lasted until 1477, was one of political and artistic prestige. Brussels became the seat of the central administrative bodies for the ducal possessions in the Low Countries, which constituted a rich centre of art and culture. Pictures by Rogier van der Weyden (the officially appointed town painter), sculptures in wood, large tapestries with historical motifs, plate, jewelry, and other products by Brussels craftsmen came to be exported in all directions. Brussels began to beautify itself: near the marketplace, the Town Hall (1402-54) rose proudly, with its tall perforated steeple surmounted by a statue of the archangel Michael, the city's patron saint. Various Gothic churches and cathedrals and the ducal Coudenberg Palace (destroyed in the 18th century), with its extensive park, added to the architectural splendour. After a prolonged political crisis caused by an abortive rebellion against the future Holy Roman emperorMaximilian I at the end of the 15th century, Brussels regained its position as a capital during the reign of Charles V (1519-56), who as Holy Roman emperor and king of Spain ruled a vast empire that included the Low Countries. Charles's three government councils (the Council of State, the Privy Council, and the Finance Council) were established permanently in Brussels, and the city's population grew to nearly 50,000 by the mid-16th century. In 1561 a canal linking Brussels with Willebroek was dug, providing direct access to the Rupel and the Schelde rivers and thus to the port of Antwerp and the North Sea. Replacing the sandy little Senne River, the Willebroek Canal played an important commercial role. The Reformation did not leave Brussels untouched. Two Lutheran preachers, the first Protestant martyrs in the Low Countries, died there at the stake in 1523, and many more Lutherans, Anabaptists, and Calvinists followed. During the revolt of the Low Countries against their Spanish Habsburg rulers (seeEighty Years' War), Brussels was under Calvinist rule from 1578 until 1585. By the latter date, however, the southern provinces of the Low Countries (which included modern-day Belgium) had separated from the northern provinces (now the Kingdom of the Netherlands), surrendered to the Spanish Habsburgs, and returned to the Roman Catholic fold. Brussels thus remained part of the Spanish-held southern provinces, or Spanish Netherlands, into the 18th century. The Counter-Reformation and the reign of Archduke Albert VII and Isabella (1598-1633) left their mark on the urban surroundings with the construction of a series of fine churches in the Italo-Flemish Baroque style, nearly all of which are still in existence. In the second half of the 17th century, there were repeated invasions by the armies of Louis XIV of France. During a bombardment by his troops in 1695, hundreds of buildings were destroyed by fire, including the various craft headquarters. Out of this catastrophe there arose new guildhalls, the architectural landmarks now surrounding the Grand' Place (Grote Markt). With control of the Spanish Netherlands passing to the Austrian Habsburgs in 1713, Brussels became part of the Austrian Netherlands. Under Austrian rule the city suffered a brief but costly occupation by French troops in 1746-48 but profited from the general economic recovery in the latter half of the 18th century, becoming a financial centre and gaining new industries. The upper part of the town was the scene of urban planning on a large scale, which resulted in the Place Royale and Brussels Park. Following the Brabant Revolution (1789-90) against the government of Holy Roman emperor Joseph II, the French republican armies made their appearance, and the Belgian principalities were annexed to France. During the Napoleonic era, Brussels was reduced to the rank of chief town of the French departement of the Dyle, losing in addition all authority over its satellite villages. (SeeFrench revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.) One of the consequences of Napoleon I's defeat at Waterloo (1815) was the creation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This reunion of the southern and northern provinces, which had been separated in the 16th century, lasted 15 years (1815-30). During this period Brussels shared the status of capital with The Hague. Its appearance changed appreciably, above all because of the demolition of the city walls (1810-40) and their replacement by tree-lined boulevards, as well as the digging of the Brussels-Charleroi Canal, which from 1832 onward made waterborne transport possible from as far as the province of Hainaut to the port of Antwerp via the capital. In 1830 came revolution; Belgium won its independence, and, in the constitution adopted by the newly elected National Congress, Brussels, which had played a major role in the uprising against the Kingdom of the Netherlands, was named the capital of Belgium and the seat of government. The Brussels elite remained predominant in Belgian national politics throughout the 19th century. Meanwhile, the city's growing political and administrative role enhanced its importance as an economic and financial centre. With a population of more than 123,000 in 1846, it became the central node of Belgium's road and railway network. Its material infrastructure was greatly improved by means of a modern sewerage and water-supply system, the introduction of public transport, and the development of new residential districts. However, as suburban areas were incorporated into the agglomeration, the fragmented local administration was streamlined only partly and gradually.

The Outcome of the Crimean War On 30th March 1856, the Crimean War was formally brought to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Paris... Jessica Brain 11 min read On 30th March 1856, the Crimean War was formally brought to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. This formal recognition signed at the Congress of Paris came after Russia accepted a humiliating defeat against the alliance of Britain, France, the Ottoman Empire and Sardinia. The treaty itself would address Russian expansionism, quashing dreams of a Russian empire equal to none, whilst at the same time confirming the importance of the Ottoman Empire in maintaining a very tentative balance of power in Europe. The Crimean War which had begun in October 1853 lasted eighteen months and in that time had escalated into a series of fragmented battles and sieges, causing huge loss of life and highlighting wider issues and failures pertaining to leadership, military intervention, mortality rates, medicine and mismanagement. The war itself garnered a great deal of attention and proved to be a significant and defining moment for Europe. It was first and foremost the embodiment of a 'modern war', using new technologies that would later characterise the wars of the next century. Furthermore, the coverage of the war in newspapers, particularly in Britain allowed the general public to experience the horrors of war in a new and provocative way, thanks to reporting by the likes of William Howard Russell for The Times newspaper. This overseas reporting combined with information from significant figures such as Florence Nightingale, would paint an extremely unfavourable picture leading to demands for reforms. Florence Nightingale Whilst the Treaty of Paris marked an important step, with all sides recognising the need for a peaceful solution, the logistics of competing interests in negotiations made it more difficult to put into practice. The main agreement did manage to create some tangible guidelines which included forcing Russia to demilitarise the Black Sea. This agreement was between the Tsar and the Sultan who maintained that no arsenal could be established on the coastline. For Russia this clause in particular proved to be a major blow, weakening its power base as it no longer could threaten the Ottoman Empire via its navy. This was thus an important step in scaling down the potential for escalating violence. In addition, the treaty agreed the inclusion of the Ottoman Empire into the Concert of Europe which was essentially a representation of the balance of power on the continent, instigated back in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna. As part of this, the European powers promised to comply with its independence and not compromise any Ottoman territory. Russia on the other hand was forced to return the city of Kars and all other Ottoman territory which it had taken into its possession. The principalities of Wallachia and Moldovia were thus returned as Ottoman territory, later granted independence and eventually turned into modern-day Romania. Russia was forced by the treaty to abandon its claim of a protectorate for Christians living in the Ottoman Empire, thus discarding the very premise which engaged Russia in war in the first place. In exchange, the alliance of powers agreed to restore the towns of Sevastpol, Balaklava, Kerch, Kinburn and many other areas back to Russia which had been occupied by the Allied troops during the war. A major consequence of this agreement was the reopening of the Black Sea for international trade and commerce. The importance of resuming trade was a major consideration for all involved, so much so that an international commission was created on the premise of establishing a free and peaceful navigation of the Danube River for the purpose of commerce. 'Le Congres de Paris' by Edouard Louis Dubufe Apart from resuming trade, the countries involved were forced into a period of reflection; with an unhappy general public, high death toll and little to show for it, leaders needed to show they were willing to make changes. This was particularly pertinent for Russia which suffered terribly, losing around 500,000 of its troops. The Crimean War thus instigated an era of self-evaluation in Russia which threw off the shackles of archaic traditions and embraced modernisation. Upon the death of Nicholas I, Alexander II became Tsar, who by comparison was liberal in his views and approach. A wave of reforms followed with the momentous decision to abolish serfdom and address issues such as its failing economy. It was at this moment that Russia would embark into a new age where educated elites would pause in a moment of retrospection, unleashing as they did so an era of creativity characterised by the great figures of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Russia took its defeat as an opportunity to resolve internal problems. Meanwhile, Crimea was significant for Britain as it marked one of its first military interventions in Europe for forty years. The repercussions for Westminster would be massive as the portrayal of the war in British media allowed the public for the first time to receive information day-by-day about the carnage abroad. Information that many would have wanted to keep quiet was available, the needless tragedy of the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade resonated strongly with a disaffected British population. The Crimean War had ended favourably for Britain and members of its fellow alliance, however its unpopularity had led to a change of leader with the Earl of Aberdeen being forced to resign via a no confidence vote in 1855. The new Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston was the preferred choice. With the increased accessibility of information and more awareness of foreign policy, the people would demand peaceful solutions. As part of this new change under Palmerston's government, an inquiry was launched in order to investigate the disastrous set of events. The report concluded that the government had been responsible for not allowing adequate supplies as well as blaming senior members of the Armed forces for certain delays. The investigation also made important headway with the evolution of modern nursing practices, prompted by the work of Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole who individually were improving the sanitation levels of field hospitals at Crimea. Lessons were there to be learnt for all governments; people were dissatisfied with leadership and a new approach needed to be found. The Treaty of Paris forced nations to address issues both internal and external. France and Britain would remain committed to reinforcing and stabilising the Ottoman Empire as much as possible in order to restore balance. This would be hard to achieve, especially with the rising tide of nationalism in Ottoman territory which threatened the Empire's very existence. The inclusion of the Ottoman Empire into the sphere of European influence was seen as essential for solving the ""eastern question"", however, the Treaty of Paris did little to address this conundrum. The treaty simply affirmed Turkey's crucial role in European peace but was not able to prevent conflict from ensuing once more. The Ottoman Empire would eventually fall in 1914. More widely, the Crimean War saw the balance of power change hands in Europe. Whilst Russia suffered a major defeat, Austria, which had chosen to remain neutral, would find itself in the coming years at the mercy of a new rising star, Germany. Under the leadership of Bismarck, who took advantage of fraught relations, new strategy for survival emerged. Austria would end up uniting with Hungary in a monarchical empire. Meanwhile, Sardinia, a participant in the alliance at Crimea would intervene in Italian affairs, ensuring that a united nation of Italy would emerge out of the territorial chasms of Europe. Traditional empires were now under threat, with Britain and France sensing the urgency and need to maintain a grip on affairs. The Crimean War highlighted how difficult it was to keep a balance of power in Europe. The end of the war resulted in a new era of relations, a new way of doing things; the old traditional empires stretched over continents gave way in Europe to the nation-state. Change was coming.

Maud Gage Baum (née Gage; March 27, 1861 – March 6, 1953) was the wife of American children's publisher L. Frank Baum. Her mother was the suffragist Matilda Joslyn Gage. In her early life, she attended a boys' high school. Maud lived in Fayetteville, New York, with her aging parents until she married Frank in 1882, sacrificing her college education at Cornell University. At the onset of their marriage, she accompanied her husband's acting troupe throughout the United States. After she became pregnant, Maud and Frank settled down in a rented house, where she gave birth to Frank Joslyn in 1883. Complications arising from giving birth to her second son Robert Stanton in 1886 caused Maud to become afflicted with peritonitis. Ill for two years, she found solace in visiting her mother and siblings. In 1889 and 1891, she gave birth to Harry Neal and Kenneth Gage, respectively. Described by her children as a no-nonsense mother, Maud took charge of the family finances and the disciplining of her children. She was their primary caretaker because her husband's business obligations frequently led to his being away for weeks at a time. The family moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota, in 1888 because Maud wished to be near her brother and two sisters. After her husband was unable to sustain a living there, they moved to Chicago. Because of their dire financial situation, Maud also worked, teaching embroidery and lace-making. Beginning in 1900, her husband's best-selling picture book, Father Goose: His Book (first published in 1899), brought the family financial security that it had theretofore lacked. They began spending their summers at a cottage in Macatawa Park, Michigan. In November of that year, Frank transferred to Maud the literary rights of his most recent books, including Father Goose and From Kansas to Fairyland (later published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). By dint of Frank's literary successes, Maud and Frank were financially secure enough to tour Egypt and Europe for six months. Since Frank was frequently occupied with penning stories for his publishers, Maud was the one who wrote numerous letters home. These letters were later published in 1907 as In Other Lands Than Ours for friends and family. After Frank died, she authorized Ruth Plumly Thompson to write more Oz sequels and helped promote MGM's film The Wizard of Oz (1939). In 1953, she died at 91 years of age, surviving her husband by 34 years. == Early life == Born on March 27, 1861 to Matilda Joslyn Gage and Henry Hill Gage Maud was the youngest of their four children. She had two sisters, Helen Leslie Gage and Julia Gage Carpenter, and a brother, Thomas Clarkson Gage. Her mother was a feminist who fought for women's rights, and her father was a prosperous dry-goods retailer. A relative noted that Maud's mother was a ""woman of force"" who ""ruled her mild, gentle husband and her four children with a rod of iron"". Maud lived with her parents in a Greek Revival home in Fayetteville, New York. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz wrote that Maud had ""dark hair, a shapely figure, and eyes as sharp as her mind"". In her youth, Maud went to a boys' high school. Both she and her future husband, L. Frank Baum, attended Syracuse Classical School, a preparatory school in Syracuse, New York. In September 1880, Maud headed to Cornell University, leaving on a train and arriving at an Ithaca depot two hours later. Her brother, Clarkson, had graduated as one of the top of the class, though her elder sisters did not attend a university. When Maud arrived at the university, she intended to be the family's first woman to receive a complete degree. Her mother dreamed of her becoming a doctor or a lawyer, which would be a rare accomplishment for a woman. Though Maud had very little knowledge about being on her own, she was not timid. When she entered the parlor of her dormitory on her first day there, she recognized a tune from the piano. Telling the girls around her that ""I dearly love dancing"", Mau

Kate Gosselin Biography Katie Irene Kreider, aka Kate Gosselin, is an illustrious American reality TV personality who achieved international prominence as the mainstay of the reality television program, 'Jon & Kate Plus 8,' endorsed by TLC. However, the immense popularity of the series catalyzed Kate's split from her husband Jon Gosselin, and ultimately led to their divorce. Long before her small screen career took off, she worked as a registered nurse in a medical center in Reading, Pennsylvania. She came across her future husband, Jon Gosselin, in a picnic arranged by the medical center and hospital where she was employed. After dating each other for nearly two years, they finally legalized their relationship via marriage. Kate opted for artificial insemination in order to conceive as she found out that polycystic ovarian syndrome prevented her from getting pregnant naturally. The couple's fertility treatments resulted in their being blessed with eight children. The TV channel 'Discovery Health' was inspired to create a program, 'Surviving Sextuplets and Twins' based on Kate and her family. The show generated so much publicity that the 'Discovery Communications' owned channel filmed another program titled, 'Sextuplets and Twins: One Year Later'. The high TRP ratings of the show opened the floodgates for Kate leading to a scintillating spell in the reality TV industry. TLC, another Discovery Communications TV channel, entered into a pact with Kate and Jon to feature them in 'Jon & Kate Plus 8'--an avant-garde reality show based on the Gosselin family. Kate Gosselin was born on March 28, 1975 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Kenton Eugene Kreider and Charlene Ruth Kreider. She has four siblings: sisters Kendra, Christen, and Clairissa, and a brother named Kevin. She completed a certificate course in nursing from 'Reading Hospital and Medical Center' in Reading, Pennsylvania. Thereafter, she took up employment as a maternity nurse in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. Continue Reading Below Marriage & Children It was while working in the hospital that Kate became acquainted with Jon Gosselin during a picnic on 5th October 1997. Following an extensive romance that went on for almost two years, Kate married Jon on 12th June 1999. Kate, after undergoing a pelvic speculum, came to know that she was suffering from PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) which would come in the way of her getting pregnant naturally. Consequently, she decided to go for artificial insemination in order to get impregnated. After undergoing the fertility treatment procedure, Kate conceived and gave birth to Cara and Madelyn, who were twins. She opted for additional fertility treatments as she and her husband were desirous of having more children. In May 2004, Kate and Jon were blessed with sextuplets--daughters Alexis, Leah, and Hannah, and sons Joel, Collin, and Aaden--thanks to fertility treatments. The sextuplets had to be placed in medical ventilators as they were born premature. Kate later revealed in her book, 'Love Is in the Mix' that there were a total of seven fetuses initially out of which one did not survive to see the light of the day. Career as a Small Screen Actress Kate and Jon, along with their eight children, all of whom were conceived via artificial insemination, generated a lot of publicity. The sextuplets, in particular, attracted the attention of the electronic media. The Gosselin family was invited by NBC TV Network to feature in 'Home Delivery', a reality show, in 2004. The offer from NBC came at a time when the couple was renovating their home in Wyomissing to house themselves and their eight offspring in 2004. NBC TV Network funded the couple's home refurbishment project. In 2005 September, the family starred in 'Surviving Sextuplets and Twins'--a special program endorsed by 'Discovery Communications' TV channel Discovery Health. The program, which was lapped up by the audiences, garnered so much publicity that Discovery Health was enthused to produce a sequel named 'Sextuplets and Twins: One Year Later' in 2006. The reality TV shows, 'Surviving Sextuplets and Twins' and 'Sextuplets and Twins: One Year Later' catapulted the Gosselins into national limelight. In 2007, Kate and Jon entered into an agreement with Discovery Health to appear in 'Jon & Kate Plus 8' a reality TV series that chronicled their lives.

'Philadelphia Magazine' further narrated that many in the audience had travelled a long distance and paid $10 to witness US's most talked about reality TV couple in the flesh. Despite the show's success, all was not well in the couple's personal lives. After Kate revealed in an episode of 'Jon & Kate Plus 8' in 2009 that she and Jon were splitting up, TLC declared that henceforth, the reality program would be aired as 'Kate Plus 8'. The couple appeared together for the last time in an episode aired in November 2009. Kate Gosselin contested in the TV program, 'Dancing with the Stars' in its 10th season in 2010.

54,when will the world end mayans?,2012,2012,"The 2012 phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and festivities took place on 21 December 2012 to commemorate the event in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed for this date. A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era. Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum; an interaction between Earth and Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy; the Nibiru cataclysm, in which Earth would collide with a mythical planet called Nibiru; or even the heating of Earth's core. Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of cataclysmic events as they arose. Mayan scholars stated that no classic Mayan accounts forecast impending doom, and the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Mayan history and culture. Astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience, having been refuted by elementary astronomical observations. == Mesoamerican Long Count calendar == December 2012 marked the conclusion of a bʼakʼtun—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Mesoamerica prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec, it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900 AD. The writing system of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a text corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the Spanish conquest of Yucatán. Unlike the 260-day tzolkʼin still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a uinal, 18 uinals (360 days) made a tun, 20 tuns made a kʼatun, and 20 kʼatuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a bʼakʼtun. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 bʼakʼtuns, 3 kʼatuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days. === Apocalypse === There is a strong tradition of ""world ages"" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation. According to the Popol Vuh, a compilation of the creation accounts of the Kʼicheʼ Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, the current world is the fourth. The Popol Vuh describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 bʼakʼtuns, or roughly 5,125 years. The Long Count's ""zero date"" was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th bʼakʼtun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer Maud Worcester Makemson wrote that ""the completion of a Great Period of 13 bʼakʼtuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."" In 1966, Michael D. Coe wrote in The Maya that ""there is a suggestion ... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [bʼakʼtun]. Thus ... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."" === Objec

What We Do in the Shadows is an American comedy horror mockumentary fantasy television series created by Jemaine Clement, first broadcast on FX on March 27, 2019. The series follows four vampire roommates on Staten Island, and stars Kayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, Harvey Guillén, Mark Proksch, and Kristen Schaal. Based on the 2014 New Zealand film of the same name, written by Clement and Taika Waititi, it is the second television series in the franchise. The show was renewed for a sixth and final season, that premiered on October 21, 2024. It has been critically acclaimed (particularly for its cast and writing) and nominated for 29 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2020, 2022, and 2024, for its second, third and fifth season, respectively. == Premise == Traditional vampires Nandor, Laszlo, and Nadja, together with energy vampire Colin Robinson, share a Staten Island residence, maintained by Nandor's familiar Guillermo. The vampires routinely clash with the modern world, other supernatural beings, and/or each other, while Guillermo earnestly endeavors to balance his loyalty to Nandor with his desire to become a vampire, complicated by his ancestry as a descendant of vampire hunter Van Helsing. == Cast and characters == === Main === Kayvan Novak as Nandor the Relentless – Once the bloodthirsty leader of the fictional kingdom of Al-Quolanudar in southern Iran and a warrior serving the Ottoman Empire. At age 760, he is the oldest vampire and the self-proclaimed leader of the group, leading him to frequently calling house meetings for frivolous discussions. Although he genuinely cares for his human familiar Guillermo, he has difficulty expressing it. Nandor is also quite naïve to the ways of modern society and humans, which often results in Guillermo becoming frustrated with him. Matt Berry as Leslie ""Laszlo"" Cravensworth – A 310-year-old vampire from British nobility who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. A pansexual and former porn actor who is often preoccupied with sexual thoughts, he enjoys sexual encounters with both Nadja and Nandor. He also enjoys making topiary sculptures of vulvas in the yard, including those of his wife and mother. Natasia Demetriou as Nadja of Antipaxos – A 500-year-old Greek Romani vampire who turned Laszlo into a vampire and later married him. She is frequently frustrated with her male housemates and nostalgic about her human life. She has entertained an affair with a reincarnated knight named Gregor for hundreds of years, only for him to be decapitated in every reincarnation. She later becomes manager of her own vampire nightclub. Demetriou also plays Nadja's human ghost, split from its corporeal form when Nadja was turned into a vampire, who inhabits a doll which has appeared since the second season. Harvey Guillén as Guillermo de la Cruz – Nandor's long-suffering Latino familiar. Despite his frustration with his unreasonable workload and Nandor's disregard for his mortality, he has served his master for more than a decade in the hope of being made a vampire. Guillermo discovers that he is a descendant of the famous vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing and proves to be very skilled at killing vampires, giving him conflicting feelings about his desire to become a vampire. Guillermo's skill as a vampire slayer leads to him becoming a bodyguard for Nandor, Nadja, and Laszlo. He comes out as gay to his family but reveals his desire to become a vampire at the same time, prompting Nadja to erase their memories of his confession. Mark Proksch as Colin Robinson (and Baby Colin / ""The Boy"") – An energy vampire who lives in the basement. He sustains himself by draining humans and fellow vampires of their life force by being extremely boring or frustrating. As a ""day walker"", he is not harmed by sunlight or entry into churches, and thus holds a regular job in an office where he feeds on his coworkers' frustrations. This also means that he financially supports the

Predictions of apocalyptic events that will result in the extinction of humanity, a collapse of civilization, or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the beginning of the Common Era. Most predictions are related to Abrahamic religions, often standing for or similar to the eschatological events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the Rapture, Great Tribulation, Last Judgment, and the Second Coming of Christ. End-time events are normally predicted to occur within the lifetime of the person making the prediction and are usually made using the Bible—in particular the New Testament—as either the primary or exclusive source for the predictions. This often takes the form of mathematical calculations, such as trying to calculate the point in time where it will have been 6,000 years since the supposed creation of the Earth by the Abrahamic God, which according to the Talmud marks the deadline for the Messiah to appear. Predictions of the end from natural events have also been theorised by various scientists and scientific groups. While these predictions are generally accepted as plausible within the scientific community, the events and phenomena are not expected to occur for hundreds of thousands, or even billions, of years from now. Little research has been carried out into the reasons that people make apocalyptic predictions. Historically, such predictions have been made for the purpose of diverting attention from actual crises like poverty and war, pushing political agendas, or promoting hatred of certain groups; antisemitism was a popular theme of Christian apocalyptic predictions in medieval times, while French and Lutheran depictions of the apocalypse were known to feature English and Catholic antagonists, respectively. According to psychologists, possible explanations for why people believe in modern apocalyptic predictions include: mentally reducing the actual danger in the world to a single and definable source; an innate human fascination with fear; personality traits of paranoia and powerlessness; and a modern romanticism related to end-times, resulting from its portrayal in contemporary fiction. The prevalence of Abrahamic religions throughout modern history is said to have created a culture that encourages the embracement of a future drastically different from the present. Such a culture is credited for the rise in popularity of predictions that are more secular in nature, such as the 2012 phenomenon, while maintaining the centuries-old theme that a powerful force will bring about the end of humanity. In 2012, opinion polls conducted across 20 countries found that over 14% of people believe the world will end in their lifetime, with percentages ranging from 6% of people in France to 22% in the United States and Turkey. Belief in the apocalypse is most prevalent in people with lower levels of education, lower household incomes, and those under the age of 35. In the United Kingdom in 2015, 23% of the general public believed the apocalypse was likely to occur in their lifetime, compared to 10% of experts from the Global Challenges Foundation. The general public believed the likeliest cause would be nuclear war, while experts thought it would be artificial intelligence. Only 3% of Britons thought the end would be caused by the Last Judgement, compared with 16% of Americans. Up to 3% of the people surveyed in both the UK and the US thought the apocalypse would be caused by zombies or alien invasion. == Past predictions == === First millennium CE === === 11th–15th centuries === === 16th century === === 17th century === === 18th century === === 19th century === === 20th century === === 21st century === == Future predictions == == Scientific far future predictions == == See also == == References == === Bibliography === == External links == Apocalyptic predictions on ReligiousTolerance",5,1,5,5

Kate Gosselin Biography Katie Irene Kreider, aka Kate Gosselin, is an illustrious American reality TV personality who achieved international prominence as the mainstay of the reality television program, 'Jon & Kate Plus 8,' endorsed by TLC. However, the immense popularity of the series catalyzed Kate's split from her husband Jon Gosselin, and ultimately led to their divorce. Long before her small screen career took off, she worked as a registered nurse in a medical center in Reading, Pennsylvania. She came across her future husband, Jon Gosselin, in a picnic arranged by the medical center and hospital where she was employed. After dating each other for nearly two years, they finally legalized their relationship via marriage. Kate opted for artificial insemination in order to conceive as she found out that polycystic ovarian syndrome prevented her from getting pregnant naturally. The couple's fertility treatments resulted in their being blessed with eight children. The TV channel 'Discovery Health' was inspired to create a program, 'Surviving Sextuplets and Twins' based on Kate and her family. The show generated so much publicity that the 'Discovery Communications' owned channel filmed another program titled, 'Sextuplets and Twins: One Year Later'. The high TRP ratings of the show opened the floodgates for Kate leading to a scintillating spell in the reality TV industry. TLC, another Discovery Communications TV channel, entered into a pact with Kate and Jon to feature them in 'Jon & Kate Plus 8'--an avant-garde reality show based on the Gosselin family.

This film was the last theatrical appearance of Debbie Reynolds before her death on December 28, 2016. One for the Money was theatrically released in the United States on January 27, 2012 and was both a critical and commercial failure. The film was panned by critics, with many criticizing the script and Heigl's performance, and grossed just $38.1 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. == Plot == In the Chambersburg neighborhood of Trenton, New Jersey, Stephanie Plum is divorced and unemployed. Seeking a job at her cousin Vinnie's bail bonds business, she blackmails him into letting her become a bail enforcement agent and tracks down fugitive Joe Morelli, her high school ex-boyfriend who has skipped his $500,000 bail. Morelli escapes the inexperienced Stephanie, who turns to veteran bounty hunter Ricardo ""Ranger"" Manoso for help. Explaining that Morelli, a vice detective, is wanted for the murder of heroin dealer Ziggy Kulesza, Ranger buys Stephanie a gun. Police officer Eddie Gazarra, Stephanie's friend, informs her that Morelli shot Ziggy at the apartment of prostitute Carmen Sanchez. Morelli claimed to act in self-defense, but no evidence could be found that Ziggy had a gun, and Carmen and another man at the apartment have disappeared. Stephanie befriends a prostitute named Lula, who points her to a boxing gym where she questions cage fighter Benito Ramirez, Carmen's boyfriend, and his manager Jimmy Alpha. Before Ramirez can assault her, she is rescued by Morelli, who reveals that Carmen was his informant and suspects Ramirez is responsible for her disappearance. Stephanie receives a threatening call from Ramirez, and commandeers Morelli's car after searching his apartment. Desperate for money, she recovers her first fugitive, delivering her nudist neighbor to the police for failure to appear. In the shower, she is confronted by Morelli and left handcuffed and naked, forcing her to call Ranger for help. She visits Carmen's apartment and meets John Cho, a neighbor who witnessed the shooting. He explains that he knocked Morelli unconscious, after which a ""flat-nosed guy"" fled the apartment. After capturing another fugitive, who first steals her gun and shoots at Ranger, Stephanie learns that Cho has been killed. She is tailed by Ramirez, who leaves Lula badly beaten outside Stephanie's apartment. Morelli asks for Stephanie's help in clearing his name, in exchange for sole credit and payment for his capture, and she agrees, allowing him to lay low at her apartment. Vinnie's regular recovery agent Morty Beyers arrives to take over Morelli's bounty, and steals the keys to Morelli's car, but is killed by a car bomb intended for Stephanie, and Carmen’s apartment building is fire-bombed. Wearing a wire so Morelli can track her movements from nearby, Stephanie spots the flat-nosed man at a butcher shop frequented by Ziggy. The man loads two barrels onto a truck, and Stephanie follows him and the butcher to a marina, where she and Morelli discover the butcher’s boat is being used to transport heroin. Hearing gunshots, they find the flat-nosed man and the butcher shot dead

Stephanie Plum is a fictional character and the protagonist in a series of novels written by Janet Evanovich. She is a spunky combination of Nancy Drew and Dirty Harry, and—although a female bounty hunter—is the opposite of Domino Harvey. She is described by the author as ""incredibly average and yet heroic if necessary"". Evanovich claims the inspiration for Stephanie's character came after watching Midnight Run starring Charles Grodin and Robert De Niro, adding, ""If Mickey Spillane wrote Archie and Veronica, Stephanie would be Betty."" As the series has progressed, Stephanie has become more stable and responsible, and a better bounty hunter. ""But truthfully,"" Evanovich says, ""Stephanie has stayed the same more than she's changed."" As of 2021, Stephanie has appeared in 28 full-length novels, four holiday novellas, and a short story in a compilation of various authors' works. The first book, One for the Money, was adapted as a 2012 film starring Katherine Heigl as Stephanie. == Character history == Evanovich admits that Stephanie Plum's character is inspired by her own, in both history and ""similar embarrassing experiences"". Evanovich says, ""I wouldn't go so far as to say Stephanie is an autobiographical character, but I will admit to knowing where she lives."" Like Evanovich, Stephanie originates from New Jersey, although Janet hails from South River and Stephanie was born in Trenton, New Jersey, the city where the series is set. Stephanie grew up in the Chambersburg neighborhood known to locals as ""the Burg"", and—like Evanovich—attended Douglass College, although Stephanie graduated ""without distinction"". The Burg is often portrayed in the series as a close-knit community, from which people rarely leave. Stephanie often finds former classmates and neighbors still living in the Burg, only a few streets away from their childhood home. After graduation, Stephanie married Dickie Orr, then promptly divorced him after discovering him in their new home, cheating on her with rival Joyce Barnhardt on their brand new dining room table. At the beginning of the first book, One for the Money, Stephanie has been laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer, she is being forced to sell off her appliances one by one in order to pay her rent, and her car is repossessed. This last straw prompts her to turn to her cousin Vinnie, owner of Vincent Plum Bail Bonds, for a job. She originally hopes to find a file clerk job at the Bail Bonds office but the position was taken, and the only position available is as an apprehension agent or bounty hunter. Vinnie refuses to hire her, but she manages to convince him to give her a shot by threatening to blackmail him. Stephanie's financial situation is still rather perilous, partially due to her poor financial skills, and she often finds herself seeking alternative ways to earn money in order to pay her bills. When the series begins, Stephanie Plum is single and living with her hamster, Rex, in an apartment building with predominantly elderly neighbors. She regularly visits her parents who live several miles away in the Burg for meals, ""family time,"" and pineapple upside-down cake. While Stephanie finds her family stressful, they often give her tips or connections which assist in her job. == Appearance == Stephanie Plum briefly describes herself in the first chapter of each book, typically mentioning her Italian-Hungarian descent, fast metabolism, with light skin, naturally curly brown hair (that she keeps shoulder-length), and blue eyes, and is 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) tall, and roughly 130 pounds (59 kg). Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy landed the role for the feature film, One for the Money, released on January 27, 2012. == Friends and colleagues == === Lula === Lula was introduced as a minor character working as a hooker in the first book in the series, One For the Money. In Two For the Dough, she becomes Vinnie's filing clerk and Stephanie's occasional partner. Stephanie refers to her as a

His story is the American story -- values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others. Barack H. Obama is the 44th President of the United States. His story is the American story -- values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others. With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank. After working his way through college with the help of scholarships and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of local steel plants. He went on to attend law school, where he became the first African--American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community. President Obama's years of public service are based around his unwavering belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years, cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending online. He was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009. He and his wife, Michelle, are the proud parents of two daughters, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11.

Barack Obama's tenure as the 44th president of the United States began with his first inauguration on January 20, 2009, and ended on January 20, 2017. Obama, a Democrat from Illinois, took office following his victory over Republican nominee John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Four years later, in the 2012 presidential election, he defeated Republican nominee Mitt Romney, to win re-election. Obama is the first African American president, the first multiracial president, the first non-white president, and the first president born in Hawaii. Obama was succeeded by Republican Donald Trump, who won the 2016 presidential election. Historians and political scientists rank him among the upper tier in historical rankings of American presidents. Obama's accomplishments during the first 100 days of his presidency included signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits; signing into law the expanded Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP); winning approval of a congressional budget resolution that put Congress on record as dedicated to dealing with major health care reform legislation in 2009; implementing new ethics guidelines designed to significantly curtail the influence of lobbyists on the executive branch; breaking from the Bush administration on a number of policy fronts, except for Iraq, in which he followed through on Bush's Iraq withdrawal of US troops; supporting the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity; and lifting the 7½-year ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. Obama also ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in Cuba, though it remains open. He lifted some travel and money restrictions to the island. Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms include: the Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as ""the ACA"" or ""Obamacare"", the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act served as economic stimuli amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. In foreign policy, he increased US troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He gained widespread praise for ordering Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the September 11 attacks. In 2011, Obama ordered the drone-strike killing in Yemen of al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki, who was an American citizen. He ordered military involvement in Libya in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During this term, he condemned the 2013 Snowden leaks as unpatriotic, but called for more restrictions on the National Security Agency (NSA) to address privacy issues. Obama also promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military interventions in Iraq and Syria in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, promoted discussions that led to th

Presidential Administration President Barack Obama delivers an address to the nation regarding Syria in the East Room of the White House, September 10, 2013. (P091013LJ-0044) Domestic policy decisions dominated the first 100 Days of the Obama administration. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which encourages fair pay for all workers and established new methods of protesting unfair paychecks, was the first signed legislation of the administration. To combat the effects of the Great Recession, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (known as the Recovery Act) in February 2009, which outlined a policy to create additional jobs, extend unemployment benefits, and established the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. In March 2010, after announcing his intent for healthcare reform in a 2009 address to Congress, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (also known as ""Obamacare""), establishing the most sweeping reforms of the American healthcare system in recent history. To improve access to healthcare coverage, the Act included a Patient's Bill of Rights to end discrimination by insurance companies based on pre-existing conditions. Among its other reforms, the Act strengthened Medicare and required the insurer to cover preventative screenings for cancer, diabetes, and blood pressure disorders. The Obama administration centered its foreign policy on drawing down the number of American forces stationed overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Obama also committed to destroying the ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) terrorist organization through the administration's comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy, including systematic airstrikes against ISIL, providing additional support to forces fighting ISIL on the ground, increased cooperation with counter-terrorism partners, and humanitarian assistance to civilians. On May 2, 2011, President Obama announced to the nation that the United States had conducted an operation that resulted in the death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Following leads from the intelligence community, the raid on bin Laden's Abbottabad compound was conducted with no American casualties. President Obama also obtained congressional approval for military action against Syria following the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons on civilians. Negotiations with Russia led to the signing of a New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) Treaty, which limited the two countries to fewer strategic arms over the course of seven years through inspections and verification. In 2015, the U.S. and other partners reached a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, which aimed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and committed Iran to further monitoring of all Iranian nuclear activities. President Obama announced plans to normalize foreign relations with Cuba in conjunction with President Castro, including reopening the U.S. Embassy in Havana in July 2015. The First Family visited Cuba in March 2016, making President Obama the first sitting President to visit the nation in 90 years.

But stories have been comparatively few about Hoon the man, not the addict, and the people he left behind. After a year, the four surviving members of Blind Melon are now speaking about the friend they remember as ""a tyrant and an angel"" - the erratic, explosive, creative, compassionate, manipulative personality Shannon Hoon was from day to day. They've released ""Nico,"" a collection of the last remaining musical vestiges of Blind Melon, in Hoon's memory. It's named for his infant daughter, Nico Blue. ""Nico"" buries the name and the entity Blind Melon along with Hoon; the four remaining members are deciding on a new singer and a new name and have decided not to play Hoon's songs again. Hoon died eight weeks after the release of Blind Melon's second album, ""Soup,"" when Nico was 13 weeks old. The band was to have played a gig in New Orleans that night. Hoon had been arrested for drunken and disorderly conduct during the recording of the album. The band's eponymous debut album went triple platinum and produced the Top 10 hit ""No Rain."" They played Woodstock 1994 and were nominated for a Grammy and American Music Award. In September 1995, Hoon was upbeat and optimistic. He was awe-struck at the birth of his daughter and vowed to be a good father. ""Having a child can make you re-evaluate how you need to be there,"" Hoon said then. ""I need to start caring about myself if I'm going to be the proper father. ""This is all fun and youth-prolonging,"" he said of his career, ""but I want to be a father, and it's hard to be when you're away."" Guitarist Rogers Stevens says Hoon's death was an accident, that he fully expected to wake up as usual the next morning. ""Shannon wasn't on a binge or anything like that,"" Stevens said in a telephone interview from New York. ""I had seen him at times throughout our history worse off. ""He had been generally healthy for a long time - he was in rehab that summer and he was staying clean on the road."" Speculation abounded that Hoon might have been pushed into touring before he was physically and emotionally ready, but Stevens argues that he was more settled and less vulnerable to temptation on the road than he was at home. ""He wanted to go on tour and he felt like he was ready,"" Stevens said. ""This was not a pressure situation. ... I think that Shannon was healthier when he was out playing and singing every night and getting his emotions out on stage."" And he insists that Hoon ""was crazy from the day I met him,"" that fame had nothing to do with his downfall. He would veer from pulling practical jokes to displaying what Stevens called ""completely irrational behavior."" ""He wasn't doing it with a safety net and he wasn't overly cautious,"" Stevens said. ""He was proceeding with this sort of abandon that you did your best to try to curb."" Stevens says the band forced Hoon into rehab twice and kept all mind-altering substances out of the band's circle. ""There (were) so many times I can't even tell you, that in the middle of the night, I'm grabbing Shannon by the ears and telling him, 'You're going to kill yourself and you're going to ruin everyone's life around you,""' Stevens said. ""There's a lot of people that you would just write off in that situation, but he was so amazing and he made up for it in so many other ways that you wanted to stay with him."" In a last-ditch effort, the band hired a counselor to keep an eye on Hoon during the ""Soup"" tour. But the singer hated the scrutiny and the other four found it equally awkward, so the counselor was let go. Hoon died shortly thereafter. ""We really felt that Shannon was doing things to spite this guy, to get to him, to make him try to leave,"" Stevens said. ""It just seemed like it was counterproductive. I (felt) that Shannon was going to get malicious towards this guy and we didn't think it was right."" Hoon's last lyrics are filled with self-examination and self-criticism. And looking back on them, the irony and foreshadowing is overwhelming. Hoon is basically chronicling and almost anticipating what is about to happen to him. He knows, as he says in ""Hell,"" that there's no way his body can keep up with his mind. He covers ""The Pusher,"" written by Hoyt Axton and made famous by Steppenwolf, and changes the lyrics so that they criticize pushers of religion rather than pushers of drugs. In retrospect, the first song the band wrote together, ""Soul One,"" could have been written for Nico. Hoon sings about finding someone who really means something to him and regrets that ""I never got the chance to say good-bye."" Even though proceeds from ""Nico"" are going to the Musician's Assistance Program, which gets free help for musicians having trouble with drugs and alcohol, Stevens says he won't become an anti-drug crusader. ""I think that our situation is an example, and what happened to Shannon is an example, and someone should be able to look at this and get it,"" he said. ""I really believe that it's wrong to try to think for other people, and I think people are best served when they're just given the information and (can) figure it out for themselves.""

ABSTRACT Bruce Lee brought attention to martial arts in the Western world and popularized the quote 'Be water, my friend'. Lee died at the age of 32 years in Hong Kong on 20 July 1973, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of death is unknown, although numerous hypotheses have been proposed, from assassination by gangsters to the more recent suggestion in 2018 that he died from heatstroke. The necropsy showed cerebral oedema. A prior episode was diagnosed as cerebral oedema 2 months earlier. We now propose, based on an analysis of publicly available information, that the cause of death was cerebral oedema due to hyponatraemia. In other words, we propose that the kidney's inability to excrete excess water killed Bruce Lee. In this regard, Lee had multiple risk factors for hyponatraemia that may have included high chronic fluid intake, factors that acutely increase thirst (marijuana) and factors that decrease the ability of the kidneys to excrete water by either promoting secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or interfering with water excretion mechanisms in kidney tubules: prescription drugs (diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, antiepileptic drugs), alcohol, chronic low solute intake, a past history of acute kidney injury and exercise. The death of Bruce Lee Bruce Lee was the most influential martial artist of all time. He inspired millions of people and brought attention to martial arts in the Western world. He was born Lee Jun-fan on 27 November 1940, in San Francisco, California, while his opera singer father was touring the United States. He returned with his parents to Hong Kong as an infant and worked as a child actor. At age 13, he began learning martial arts. At age 18, he returned to the United States where he studied drama and philosophy and opened a martial arts school. At age 26, he first appeared as a martial arts fighter on American television. Lee created his own combat method that he called Jeet Kune Do or the Way of the Intercepting Fist, which combined different training methods such as kung fu, fencing, boxing and philosophy. He popularized philosophical quotes, such as the one starting 'Be water, my friend...' [1]. He returned to Hong Kong at the age of 29, where he became a writer, director, lead actor and fight scene choreographer. Lee died at the age of 32 in Hong Kong on 20 July 1973, under mysterious circumstances. Up to now, the cause of Bruce Lee's death is unknown, although numerous hypotheses have been put forward, from assassination by triad gangsters to the more recent suggestion in 2018 that he died from heatstroke (Table 1) [2, 3]. Table 1. Theories about the cause of Bruce Lee's death. Theories For Against Hypersensitivity to Equagesic Official cause of death Not first time of consumption No typical salicylate overdose signs/symptoms Toxicology report (?) Assassinated by Mafia (Italian, Chinese, or American) 2 weeks before death, Lee threatened Lo Wei, who was reported to have mobster connections No evidence of physical injury or poison in autopsy Family curse Lee's son, Brandon Lee, died at the age of 28 years: he was shot in a film set when a prop gun fired a live bullet Bruce Lee's older brother died at the age of 3 months under mysterious circumstances Cannabis Necropsy found marijuana in stomach Oral ingestion is not likely to lead to acute intoxication Heatstroke 20 July 1973 was reported to be a very warm day 20 July 1973 not warmer than average for summer in Hong Kong Sudden death is unusual No evidence of multiorgan dysfunction in necropsy The facts Some facts about Bruce Lee's death are public [3]. On the day of his death, he and the producer of his films, Raymond Chow, drove to the house of Betty Ting Pei, who was thought to be the mistress of Lee. Lee spent some hours alone with Ting Pei and used marijuana before driving to the house, and while there Lee actively acted out some scenes of an upcoming movie. He experienced headache and dizziness around 7:30 pm, after drinking water. Ting Pei gave him an 'Equagesic' pill (a combination of meprobamate and aspirin which he had taken before) and Lee went to the bedroom to rest. Raymond Chow left at that time. At 9:30 pm, Ting Pei found Lee unconscious. She called Chow who went to the house and tried to wake Lee up without success. They called a doctor, who spent another 10 min unsuccessfully doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Lee was sent to the nearest hospital, where he was pronounced dead. At autopsy, there were no signs of external injuries and no tongue bite. Severe cerebral oedema had resulted in brain weight of 1575 g compared with the normal 1400 g [4]. Traces of marijuana were found in the stomach. Bruce Lee's death was officially ruled to be the result of cerebral oedema caused by hypersensitivity to Equagesic. Theories about the cause of death Among the multiple plausible and implausible causes of death, three merit discussion. Cerebral oedema caused by hypersensitivity to Equagesic [5]. Hypersensitivity to the components of Equagesic (aspirin and meprobamate) was identified as the official cause of death [4]. However, Lee had taken this drug before [3] and on the day of his death, he took it AFTER he felt unwell, already having symptoms that may be explained by cerebral oedema (i.e. headache) and cerebral oedema would not be expected to be the only necropsy finding if indeed hypersensitivity to Equagesic was the cause of death. Epilepsy. A seizure was considered a potential cause of the 10 May 1973 episode described below, although as it was a sole episode, a diagnosis of epilepsy was not made. On 29 and 30 May 1973, Lee underwent a full neurologic evaluation: 'a complete physical, a brain flow study, and an electroencephalogram', reviewed by neurologist David Reisbord, who did not find abnormalities in his brain functions [3]. Nevertheless, phenytoin was prescribed and Lee was on phenytoin up to the day of his death. Martial artists are at high risk of head trauma or even microtrauma [6]. The most important direct epilepsy-related cause of death is a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is more common in patients with chronic epilepsy [7]. Forensic reports can include tongue bites (20-40%), cerebral oedema and pulmonary oedema [7, 8]. The fact that he had no chronic epilepsy, was on antiepileptic drug therapy and had no tongue bite in necropsy argue against this diagnosis. Heatstroke. This latest hypothesis about the cause of death was proposed by Matthew Polly in his 2018 book Bruce Lee, A Life [3]. Heatstroke refers to when body core temperature increases above 40degC, associated with hot dry skin and central nervous system abnormalities [9]. In 2014, the Japanese Association of Acute Medicine (JAAM), published criteria for heat-related illnesses, including heatstroke. A 2016 JAAM Heat Stroke Working Group simplified heatstroke definition to consider patients exposed to high environmental temperature and at least one of the following criteria: (i) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of <=14; (ii) creatinine or total bilirubin levels of >=1.2 mg/dL; (iii) JAAM Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) score of >=4 [10]. Typically, heatstroke results from strenuous exercise (exertional) or from an inability to regulate body temperature (non-exertional), in patients with risk factors such as older age, obesity, heart disease, dementia and others [9]. Initially, heat exposure leading to hyperthermia facilitates the leakage of endotoxin from intestinal mucosa and interleukins from muscles to the systemic circulation, thereby causing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome [10], disruption of the blood-brain barrier and cerebral oedema [11]. Typically, the disorder has three phases resulting in death after 24-96 h, hence sudden death is unusual [12]. Matthew Polly [13] hypothesized that Lee's removal of axillary sweat glands a month prior to 10 May 1973 could increase the risk of heatstroke. However, sweat is produced through most of the skin surface and sweat output may vary from 0.002 mg/min/gland in the foot's dorsum to 0.016 mg/min/gland in the chest [14]. Thus, it is unlikely that axillary sweat gland removal alone could facilitate heatstroke. Polly further suggested that the 10 May 1973 episode was probably also due to heatstroke [13] and that both days had been uncharacteristically warm for Hong Kong. However, profuse sweating was described during the 10 May episode, despite axillary sweat gland removal [4], the 25degC and 32degC temperatures in both days are common in Hong Kong and there is no evidence that a previous heatstroke episode is a risk factor for a recurrent episode [12]. Overall, the time-course, ability to sweat and lack of extreme weather and of reports by witnesses of excessive heat or skin temperature or dry skin despite a warm environment argue against heatstroke. Causes of cerebral oedema Any hypothesis about the cause of death should account for the necropsy finding of cerebral oedema without further evidence of central nervous system injury and for the acute time-course of the final illness. The four main pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebral oedema are as follows. (i) Vasogenic; commonly seen in conditions with disruption of the blood-brain barrier, e.g. peritumor oedema. (ii) Cellular or cytotoxic; the consequence of brain injury, such as trauma or stroke. (iii) Interstitial oedema resulting from the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid from the intraventricular space to interstitial areas, e.g. hydrocephalus or meningitis. (iv) Osmotic oedema; in which the cells of the brain pull water from the plasma, due to a disequilibrium in osmolarity, e.g. during hyponatraemia [15]. Thus, hyponatraemia stands out as a serious possibility that may account for cerebral oedema and the time-course of the illness, as it is well accepted that acute hyponatraemia itself can be lethal if not treated promptly [16]. Could hyponatraemia-induced cerebral oedema have killed Bruce Lee? Water homeostasis The balance of water in the body is regulated by plasma osmolarity: increased plasma osmolarity (hypertonicity) is sensed by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus that regulate both antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release and thirst (Figure 1). Serum sodium concentration (natraemia) reflects water balance. Natraemia is the main contributor to serum osmolarity and an increase in natraemia (and the associated increase in serum osmolarity) will trigger compensatory mechanisms, i.e. thirst, leading to water ingestion and increased secretion of ADH (vasopressin), leading to decreased kidney excretion of water, i.e. a lower volume of more concentrated urine. Conversely, excess body water will decrease natraemia and serum osmolality, leading to the disappearance of thirst and ADH (which has an extremely short half-life) and thus, increased kidney excretion of water in more dilute urine, leading to polyuria and restoring homeostasis. Other forms of water elimination, such as breathing, faeces and sweat, are not regulated. The adaptive capacity of the kidneys is large and in patients with defects in urine concentration (e.g. genetic defects in ADH receptors or aquaporin 2) urine volumes may reach 18-20 L/day. Therefore, it is unusual to develop hyponatraemia (i.e. water intoxication) unless the rate of water intake is clearly superior to this rate of water excretion or there are predisposing factors that limit the kidney's ability to excrete water. However, this high volume may be surpassed by excessive free water drinking over short periods of time: urinating 20 L/day would translate into being able to handle an excess free water intake of around 0.8 L/h. Acute or hyperacute water loading during 'dare' activities involving ingestion of large amounts of water over a short period of time is a cause of cerebral oedema and death within a few hours, even for individuals without risk factors for hyponatraemia. Death due to hyponatraemia leading to cerebral oedema can occur within a few hours of greatly exceeding this rate of water intake, as in recent cases in which 7-8 L of water were ingested within a few hours during 'dare activities' [17, 18]. These persons are usually young and healthy. However, even if a reasonable water intake limit is not exceeded, there are factors that limit the kidneys' ability to excrete a water load, further decreasing the safe amounts of water intake when water intake is not needed. These factors may result in severe hyponatraemia from drinking a much lower water load. Could hyponatraemia have occurred in an apparently healthy young sportsman like Lee? FIGURE 1: Water balance homeostasis and Bruce Lee's risk factors for hyponatraemia. Hypernatraemia means that there is a deficiency in extracellular water and the body adapts by increasing water intake through thirst and decreasing water loss in urine by secreting antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which results in more a concentrated, lower amount of urine (A). If hyponatraemia develops, these mechanisms will be shut down, resulting in an increased volume of more dilute urine (B). Severe hyponatraemia may result from failure to timely shut down mechanisms that increase water intake and decrease water excretion once hyponatraemia has developed (C). Severe hyponatraemia may trigger cerebral oedema and herniation through the foramen magnum in the occipital bone of the skull, resulting in death within hours. Green arrows indicate adaptive mechanisms. Red arrows indicate mechanisms that are inappropriately activated and not in line with physiological needs to maintain water homeostasis. Lee had several risk factors for severe hyponatraemia that interfered with all levels of control of water balance, from thirst to ADH secretion to ADH action in the kidneys to decrease water excretion in urine. Past personal history potentially relevant to the cause of death The existence of predisposing factors that interfere with water excretion by the kidneys is the most common cause of hyponatraemia and Lee did not appear to have drunk 6-8 L of free water as in some case reports of excessive water ingestion by healthy people. So, did Lee have factors predisposing to hyponatraemia? A brief overview of publicly available information suggests that this is the case. Prior cerebral oedema episode. Lee had suffered a first episode of cerebral oedema 2 months earlier. On 10 May 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong doing a dubbing session. Polly refers to a visit to the bathroom, hash use, headache ('He felt faint and his head hurt'), disorientation and inability to walk ('While in the bathroom, Bruce became disoriented and collapsed facedown on the floor', 'Sweating star wobbled back to the dubbing room on rubbery legs. The moment he stepped inside the scorching room he fainted again, losing consciousness. Then he vomited his lunch of spaghetti and his body began convulsing' [3] (Table 2). They took him to Baptist Hospital where cerebral oedema was diagnosed and treated with mannitol. Lee recovered, and on 25 May 1973, he was examined in the United States by Dr. Harold L. Karpman. In his book Unsettled Matters, Tom Bleecker states that during the inquest on Lee's death, 'Dr Karpman said that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at Baptist Hospital had been 92 mg/dL, but was normal on May 25 when Karpman examined Lee' [4]. Thus, Lee appeared to have had acute kidney injury (AKI) and kidney dysfunction is a risk factor for hyponatraemia. A neurologist mentioned that Lee might have an idiopathic seizure disorder and prescribed phenytoin, but epilepsy was not diagnosed as this was an isolated episode. Lee's wife, Linda, stated: 'Dr Reisbord told me that at no time had Bruce suffered from epilepsy' [13]. Table 2. Lee's symptoms as compared with a prior report of a patient dying from hyperacute hyponatraemia-induced cerebral oedema. Jennifer Strange participated in a radio show contest called 'Hold your wee for a wii' and drank 6-7 L of water in under 3 h before dying from severe hyponatraemia [19]. Other examples can be found in a recent review [20]. Lee Jennifer Strange Headache Headache 'Feel faint' 'Feel lightheaded' Difficulty standing/walking. 'wobbled back to the dubbing room on rubbery legs' Excess water intake. Lee's wife Linda referred to a fluid-based diet ('carrot and apple juice'). On the evening that Lee died, Polly repeatedly refers to water intake during the day, including just before Lee became noticeably ill. 'I think we had some water... that probably made him a little tired and thirsty. After a few sips he seemed to be a little dizzy... Immediately after feeling faint, Bruce complained of a headache' [3]. The excess fluid intake appears to have become a habit for Lee. We suggest that the fact that water intake was repeatedly noticed when it is such a commonplace activity that might have been forgotten given the exceptional circumstances means that it was indeed noticeably higher than the intake of other persons present on the day that Lee died. Cannabis. The use of multiple drugs use by Lee has been reported by Bleecker and multiple sources comment on his frequent uses of hash or marijuana, including on his final day. In July 2021, the English newspaper The Times, published a piece of a newly found letter collection written by Bruce Lee: 'Stoned as hell, but am working on the up-coming character, some coke would help in the formation of what I want to create' [22]. On the evening that Lee died, Polly repeatedly refers to cannabis use throughout the day. Cannabis causes thirst [23] and may have been driving water intake despite the putative presence of hyponatraemia that we hypothesize. Hyponatraemia has also been linked to cocaine, although reports are uncommon [24]. However, there is no publicly available evidence of cocaine use on the day of his death. Alcohol. Alcohol use has been linked to an increased risk of hyponatraemia. There are reports of increased alcohol intake in the last months of Lee's life: 'would drink ten to twenty ceramic bottles of sake in an evening.' 'Near the end,' Lowe added, 'Bruce was often very tired and dizzy' [4]; his friends say he was drinking alcohol more frequently [3]. Low dietary solute intake. The association of excess alcohol intake with hyponatraemia is in part related to a low dietary solute intake. There is evidence that indeed in his last months, Lee's solute intake was low while water intake was high. An abnormal dietary pattern had been observed by physicians. Bleecker states that 'Dr Au's advised Bruce to begin eating a balanced and proper diet' and 'According to Linda, during her husband's final months, he had stopped eating solid food and was existing miserably on carrot and apple juice' [4]. This dietary pattern of mostly fluid may have explained the weight loss that appears to have accelerated between May and July 1973. In textbooks, this low solute diet has been labelled as a 'tea and toast diet' (Table 3). Table 3. Major causes of hypotonic hyponatraemia [21]. Those that may have applied to Lee, according to publicly available information, are underlined. Bleecker states that Lee complained to Dr. Harold L. Karpman in May 1973 of a poor appetite and that he had lost 20 pounds over a 2-year period. He further adds: 'In Bruce's particular case, it is important to realize that a loss of twenty pounds of body weight over a two-year period is highly significant. Besides his overuse of diuretics, which significantly reduced his body's percentage of water, Bruce had an extremely low percentage of body fat. The result was that under these conditions a loss of over 14% of his body's muscular mass was noticeable in Bruce and made him appear emaciated...' And 'From the day of his near-fatal collapse on May 10 to the day he died nearly ten weeks later, Bruce underwent an inexplicable and startling weight loss' [4]. Polly indicates, referring to the May event: 'He had lost 15% of his total body weight in the previous two months, and he had minimal body fat to start'; 'But to me, he seemed awfully run down. In all the years I knew him, I never saw him in such an emaciated condition before.' 'Yeah, I've lost a lot of weight from working day and night,' Bruce explained... 'I even forget to eat' [3]. Prescription drugs. Prescription drugs may be the primary cause of severe hyponatraemia [25]. However, the molecular mechanisms of the contribution of some drugs to hyponatraemia have not been completely clarified or may involve several mechanisms. Bleecker writes that during the inquest, 'he quickly became bored with the complex scientific analysis of the wide assortment of prescription drugs Bruce had been taking' [4]. This points to the use of other prescription drugs that may have had an impact over predisposition to hyponatraemia. These included diuretics, phenytoin and painkillers (e.g. opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs). Lee was taking phenytoin and Doloxene (dextropropoxyphene, an analgesic in the opioid category, apparently in combination with aspirin) [3]. Diuretics. Diuretic use may have contributed to both AKI and hyponatraemia. Bleecker [4] states that 'Bruce was a frequent user of diuretics. Although this greatly reduced the excessive water content in his muscles, and thus gave him the desired 'ripped' appearance, it was a dangerous practice that frequently placed him in a life-threatening state of dehydration' [4]. While we have no clear idea of what diuretics were involved, thiazides are known to cause hyponatraemia, while loop diuretics increase free water clearance in persons with normal kidney function. However, even loop diuretics favour hyponatraemia primarily due to hypovolaemia-induced release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), especially if water intake is high and distal delivery is very low, as may occur during diuretic-induced kidney dysfunction [26]. Opioids. We found no report on dextropropoxyphene and hyponatraemia, but other opioids, such as tramadol may cause hyponatraemia [27]. Opioids may promote ADH secretion but may also favour hyponatraemia when ADH is absent [28]. Additionally, they may suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone, favouring secondary adrenal insufficiency, another cause of hyponatraemia [29]. Opioids are mostly associated with hyponatraemia in combination with other drugs predisposing to hyponatraemia [30, 31]. NSAIDs. NSAIDs decrease the inhibitory effect of prostaglandins on the activity of ADH, favouring hyponatraemia under conditions of non-suppressible ADH such as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or in the presence of volume depletion (as may be expected in diuretic users), and increase the risk of hyponatraemia in patients on diuretics [18]. However, aspirin is among the NSAIDs with a lower impact on natraemia. Antiepileptic drugs. Diverse antiepileptic drugs can predispose to hyponatraemia. For newly initiated antiepileptic drugs, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for hospitalization due to hyponatraemia, compared with controls, have been reported to be 9.63 (6.18-15.33) for carbamazepine and 4.83 (1.14-25.76) for phenytoin [32]. The risk is lower for chronic users. Anabolic steroids and adrenal insufficiency. According to Bleecker, Lee had been on and off anabolic steroids that he combined with diuretics to prevent steroid-induced fluid retention [4]. While off steroids, Bleecker suggested that he may have developed adrenal insufficiency. It is unclear what steroids he might have used and whether they may have suppressed adrenal function leading to adrenal insufficiency while off them, as performance-enhancing steroids usually have androgenic properties. However, chronic administration of opiates has the potential to cause secondary adrenal insufficiency [33] while phenytoin accelerates the metabolism of cortisol [34] and the combination of both may exacerbate any underlying predisposition to adrenal insufficiency. As indicated above, adrenal insufficiency is a further cause of hyponatraemia. Kidney dysfunction. Lee appeared to have had an episode of AKI (i.e. an acute decrease in the kidney function of glomerular filtration) at the time of the first cerebral oedema episode that later recovered. This is unusual for an apparently healthy person, but diuretics may decrease kidney function through hypovolemia (i.e. loss of sodium in the urine). AKI may interfere with several kidney functions, including water excretion. Exercise. Exercise-associated hyponatraemia is defined as hyponatraemia occurring during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity [35]. It has been mainly observed in endurance athletes in long events such as marathons. It is thought to depend on excess water intake when ADH is suboptimally suppressed because of intense exercise itself, nausea and/or vomiting, hypoglycaemia, pain, or release of muscle-derived interleukin-6 and may be exacerbated by NSAIDs [31]. Lee's exercise while actively acting out some scenes in his last day of life does not appear to qualify as a single trigger for exercise-associated hyponatraemia, it could have been a further contributing factor on top of those already discussed. Summary of the evidence The answer to the question of whether Lee had factors predisposing to hyponatraemia is yes, not only one, but multiple factors that predispose to hyponatraemia: High chronic fluid intake. Factors that acutely increase thirst and water intake: marijuana, plus evidence that he was repeatedly drinking water on the day of his death. Factors that decrease the ability of the kidney to excrete a water load because they either increase ADH secretion or impair the collecting tubular response to ADH: prescription drugs (diuretics, NSAIDs, opioids, antiepileptic drugs), alcohol, chronic low solute intake, potentially an acute decrease in glomerular filtration rate such as that observed in May 1973, and exercise. In summary, Lee had multiple risk factors predisposing to hyponatraemia resulting from interference with water homeostasis mechanisms that regulate both water intake and water excretion (Table 3, Figure 1), a clinical presentation consistent with hyponatraemia and a necropsy finding of cerebral oedema which is the cause of death in severe hyponatraemia. This predisposition may have caused pre-existing asymptomatic hyponatraemia, which is associated with a high risk for the development of worsening hyponatraemia with altered mental status [36]. Pre-existing hyponatraemia was found in over 70% of all patients admitted with symptomatic hyponatraemia and represented the most common risk factor identified. Additionally, in patients with a baseline risk of hyponatraemia due to other factors, an increase in the number of prescription drugs that predispose to hyponatraemia synergistically increases the risk of hyponatraemia (Figure 2) [31]. Thus, even if some of the risk factors identified in the present report were not actually present or had a mild influence by themselves, the presence of multiple risk factors may explain the sequence of events that led to Lee's demise. FIGURE 2: Prescription drugs and risk for hyponatraemia. A higher number of prescription drugs associated with hyponatraemia further increases the risk of hyponatraemia in patients with other predisposing factors. Bar graph built using data from reference [31]. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we hypothesize that Bruce Lee died from a specific form of kidney dysfunction: the inability to excrete enough water to maintain water homeostasis, which is mainly a tubular function. This may lead to hyponatraemia, cerebral oedema and death within hours if excess water intake is not matched by water excretion in urine, which is in line with the timeline of Lee's demise. Given that hyponatraemia is frequent, as is found in up to 40% of hospitalized persons [37] and may cause death due to excessive water ingestion even in young healthy persons, there is a need for a wider dissemination of the concept that excessive water intake can kill. The fact that we are 60% [38] water does not protect us from the potentially lethal consequences of drinking water at a faster rate than our kidneys can excrete excess water. Ironically, Lee made famous the quote 'Be water my friend', but excess water appears to have ultimately killed him.

60,where is tyrese gibson from?,Durham,Watts,"Tyrese Darnell Gibson (born December 30, 1978) is an American R&B singer and actor from Los Angeles, California. He signed with RCA Records in 1998, and released his debut single ""Nobody Else"" in August of that year. It peaked within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and preceded his self-titled debut album (1998), which received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned his second top 40 single, ""Sweet Lady"". His second and third albums, 2000 Watts (2001) and I Wanna Go There (2002), both received gold certifications by the RIAA. The latter was led by the single ""How You Gonna Act Like That"", which peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting song. His fourth album, Alter Ego (2006), explored hip hop under the pseudonym Black Ty, while his fifth album, Open Invitation (2011) received a nomination for Best R&B Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Gibson's sixth album, Black Rose (2015), debuted atop the Billboard 200. Gibson has sold over 4 million singles and albums in the United States. Gibson had his first starring role in John Singleton's coming-of-age hood film Baby Boy (2001), and gained widespread recognition as Roman Pearce in the Fast & Furious franchise. Gibson reunited with Singleton for the action film Four Brothers (2005) and plays Robert Epps in the Transformers franchise. He appeared in the comedy film Ride Along 2 (2016) and the superhero film Morbius (2022). == Early life == Gibson was born and raised in Watts, Los Angeles, California. His mother, Priscilla Murray Gibson (née Durham), raised him and his three older siblings as a single parent after his father, Tyrone Gibson, left. While growing up in Watts on 113th Street during the late 80s, Gibson was exposed to gangs, with some of his childhood friends becoming members of the Crips. In his autobiography, Tyrese stated it was an older gangster named ""Dirtbike Fred"" that encouraged him to take a different path. He later graduated from Locke High School in 1996. == Music career == === Beginnings === Gibson's career began when he auditioned for a Coca-Cola commercial at the suggestion of his high school music teacher.

Granville Sharp (10 November 1735 – 6 July 1813) was an English scholar, philanthropist and one of the first campaigners for the abolition of the slave trade in Britain. Born in Durham, he initially worked as a civil servant in the Board of Ordnance. His involvement in abolitionism began in 1767 when he defended a severely injured slave from Barbados in a legal case against his master. Increasingly devoted to the cause, he continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, and in 1769 he published the first tract in England that explicitly attacked the concept of slavery. Granville Sharp's efforts culminated in 1772 when he was instrumental in securing Lord Mansfield's ruling in Somerset v Stewart, which held that slavery had no basis in English law. In 1787, Sharp and Thomas Clarkson founded the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. The continuing campaigns of Sharp, Clarkson and William Wilberforce led to the abolition of slave trade through the Slave Trade Act 1807. Sharp died in 1813, two decades before the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire. In addition to his abolitionist cause, Sharp also championed the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, which encouraged black people in Britain to settle in west Africa. His efforts led to the founding of the Province of Freedom and later Freetown. He was also an advocate for the American colonists, parliamentary reform and the legislative independence of Ireland. An accomplished classicist and biblical scholar, Sharp was also one of the founders of the British and Foreign Bible Society. == Life == Granville Sharp was the son of Judith Wheler (d. 1757) and Thomas Sharp (1693–1759), Archdeacon of Northumberland, prolific theological writer and biographer of his father, John Sharp, Archbishop of York. Judith was the daughter of travel writer George Wheler and Grace née Higgons, who grew up in the political household of Sir Thomas Higgons. Sharp was born in Durham in 1735. He had eight older brothers and five younger sisters. Five of his brothers survived their infancy and by the time Sharp had reached his midteens the family funds set aside for their education had been all but depleted, so Sharp was educated at Durham School but mainly at home. He was apprenticed to a London linen-draper at the age of fifteen. Sharp loved to argue and debate, and his keen intellect found little outlet in the mundane work in which he was involved. However, one of his fellow-apprentices was Socinian (a Unitarian sect that denied the divinity of Christ), and in order better to argue, Sharp taught himself Greek. Another fellow apprentice was Jewish, and so Sharp learned Hebrew in order to be able to discuss theological matters with his colleague. Sharp also conducted genealogical research for one of his masters, Henry Willoughby, who had a claim to the barony of Willoughby de Parham, and it was through Sharp's work that Willoughby was able to take his place in the House of Lords. Sharp's apprenticeship ended in 1757, and both his parents died soon after. That same year he accepted a position as Clerk in the Ordnance Office at the Tower of London. This civil service position allowed him plenty of free time to pursue his scholarly and intellectual pursuits. Sharp had a keen musical interest. Four of his siblings – William, later to become surgeon to George III, James, Elizabeth and Judith – had also come to London, and they met every day. They all played musical instruments as a family orchestra, giving concerts at William's house in Mincing Lane and later in the family sailing barge, Apollo, which was moored at the Bishop of London's steps in Fulham, near William's country home, Fulham House. The fortnightly water-borne concerts took place from 1775–1783, the year his brother James died. Sharp had an excellent bass voice, described by George III as ""the best in Britain"", and he played the clarinet, oboe, fl",1,1,5,1

That year, she published her first cookbook, Paula's Home Cooking with Paula Deen.",Albany High School,"Paula Deen Paula Deen is a TV personality known for hosting such culinary shows as 'Paula's Home Cooking,' 'Paula's Party' and 'Paula's Best Dishes.' Updated: Sep 09, 2022 3:39 PM EDT Aaron Davidson/Getty Images (1947-) Who Is Paula's Dean? From Paula's Home Cooking to Top Chef, Paula Deen was a fixture on the Food Network for more than a decade. She has also written several books on Southern cooking, as well as a memoir, and has started her own magazine, Cooking with Paula Deen. Following a racially charged controversy that led to her departure from the Food Network, she returned to TV hosting in 2016 with Positively Paula. Early Life Born on January 19, 1947, in Albany, Georgia, Paula Deen went to Albany High School and married her first husband after graduating in 1965. Her parents both died by the time she was 23, a loss that led Deen into panic attacks and chronic agoraphobia. She retreated into her cooking, eventually starting a home-based catering business, The Bag Lady, with her two sons serving as deliverymen. The Bag Lady was a hit, and its popularity forced Deen to expand beyond the confines of her kitchen. In January 1996, she opened her own restaurant, The Lady and Sons, in downtown Savannah, which she ran with her two sons. By 1999, USA Today had awarded The Lady and Sons its ""International Meal of the Year"" title. The restaurant, like Deen's catering company, was also wildly popular, and her first cookbook, The Lady and Sons Savannah Country Cookbook, soon followed; the book gave readers a chance to try Deen's recipes at home and, in turn, led to her first TV appearance, on the QVC shopping channel. TV Stardom After a few guest appearances on Food Network shows, Deen shot a pilot in early 2001 for the network, called Afternoon Tea. The network gave the show a thumbs-up, and Deen landed her own show in 2002, Paula's Home Cooking. With the success of that series, the Food Network debuted Paula's Party in 2006. Her sons, Bobby and Jamie, began making appearances with Paula on both shows, and the network gave them their own show, Road Tasted, that same year. In 2005, on the heels of her hit shows, Deen launched a lifestyle magazine called Cooking with Paula Deen, and in 2006 she published her third cookbook, Paula Deen Celebrates! Deen's memoirs, It Ain't All About the Cooking, were published in 2007, and The Deen Family Cookbook (2009) and Paula Deen's Southern Cooking Bible (2011) rounded out her writing efforts. Not quite finished with her TV domination, Deen debuted yet another cooking show, Food Network's Paula's Best Dishes, in June 2008. For her efforts, in June 2007, Deen won a Daytime Emmy Award (outstanding lifestyle host) for Paula's Home Cooking. In October 2010, she was selected as the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade. Racial Controversy In June 2013, Deen found herself the subject of intense media scrutiny. It became public around this time that she had admitted to using the N-word during a legal deposition taken that May. Deen and her brother had been sued by a former employee for racial and sexual harassment. She also stated that it had been long time since she had used the offensive term in her testimony. Deen faced harsh criticism for her admission. In a video posted on YouTube, she acknowledged that she had made a mistake. ""Inappropriate, hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable,"" she said. In another video, Deen insisted that she was not racist. ""Your color of your skin, your religion, your sexual preferences does not matter to me."" In reaction to this controversy, the Food Network decided not to renew Deen's contract with the cable channel. Some of Deen's fans expressed their outrage over Deen's firing, leaving messages on the Food Network's Facebook page and threatening to boycott the channel. Despite these protests, the Food Network stood by its decision to end its relationship with Deen after 11 years. Later that month, Deen was dropped by her publisher, Ballantine Books. The publishing company, which is a division of Random House, decided to cancel her upcoming cookbook Paula Deen's New Testament. Rebuilding Her Career After being dropped by her network and publisher, Deen sought to regain her celebrity chef status. She reached out directly to her fans through her tour with Paula Dean Live!, an event featuring cooking demonstrations. In June 2014, Dean also announced plans to start her own network online. The Paula Deen Network launched in September 2014 with such original shows as 20-Minute Meals and Paula Cooking Light. Continuing her comeback, Deen in 2015 competed on Dancing with the Stars. In late 2016, she began hosting Positively Paula, a family-friendly cooking show taped from her home in Savannah, Georgia.

About Paula As a young girl growing up in Albany, Georgia, Paula Deen never dreamed she would become an American icon. As a young mother, Paula was living the American dream--married to her high school sweetheart, raising two adorable boys--when tragedy struck. Her parents died, her marriage failed, and she began a prolonged battle with agoraphobia. With her boys in their teens and her family near homelessness, Paula took her last $200, reached deep inside her soul, and started The Bag Lady, a home-based catering company that marked the start of Deen's professional cooking career. With sons Jamie and Bobby delivering ""lunch-and-love-in-a-bag,"" beginning in June 1989, Paula turned around her life by sharing what she knew best--traditional Southern cooking. Overcoming poverty, self-doubt, and health challenges to achieve success and acclaim, Paula has become one of the best-known personalities in the world of cooking. Yet the most remarkable part of Paula Deen's journey from her kitchen to fame is that Paula has remained every bit as genuine, real, and full of love as she was the day the first meals left her kitchen. Deen's first business, The Bag Lady, brought out Paula's strengths and stabilized her family. She moved her catering company to a small restaurant at a Best Western motel in Savannah and finally opened her first restaurant, The Lady and Sons, with Bobby and Jamie five years later. The restaurant was a hit, and the popularity of Paula and her cooking led to her first cookbook, 1998's The Lady and Sons Savannah Country Cookbook. This gave her fans the opportunity to try Paula's recipes at home and led to her first television appearance on QVC. Paula's genuine warmth and folksy personality made her a natural for television. In 1999, USA Today food critic Jerry Shriver named The Lady and Sons ""International Meal of the Year."" Since then, Paula's business interests have grown considerably. In 2011, Paula Deen Foods was launched and in 2013, they introduced food products developed in Paula's kitchen and based on both her traditional recipes and lighter versions. In 2014, Paula launched her nationwide live tour, Paula Deen Live!, which consisted of 90-minute shows featuring Paula making her favorite seasonal dishes. She also played fun, interactive games with her fans and shared stories on stage with her husband, Michael. For the first time ever, fans had the chance to interact with Paula personally and sample her delicious Southern creations. In 2015, Paula launched her free mobile game, Paula Deen's Recipe Quest; premiered her first show on EVINE; and launched her podcast, What's Cooking with Paula Deen, and radio show, Get Cooking with Paula Deen. That year, she also launched her own line of dog food called Paula Deen Hugs Healthy Adult Dog Food. In the fall of 2015, Paula released her cookbook, Paula Deen Cuts The Fat: 250 Favorite Recipes All Lightened Up, which reached TheNew York Times Best Sellers List in under a week. Simultaneously, she competed in the twenty-first season of ABC's hit show ""Dancing with the Stars,"" and successfully made it halfway through the competition. Her most recent book, Love & Best Dishes: A Collection of Recipes, Stories & Letters from the Heart, is part cookbook and part memoir, making it her most intimate work yet. Love & Best Dishes is Paula's 20th book. Since 2015, Paula has opened four new Paula Deen's Family Kitchen restaurants in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Branson, Missouri; and Nashville, Tennessee; along with The Chicken Box, a grab-and-go lunch option in Savannah, Georgia. In the fall of 2016, Paula launched two new television shows, Positively Paula and Sweet Home Savannah. Positively Paula, a nationally syndicated show, welcomes fans into her personal kitchen while she cooks, shares stories, and visits with family and friends. Sweet Home Savannah on EVINE invited Paula's fans into her Savannah home each week for a live, two-hour show, filled with her fashion, kitchen products, and home textiles. Today, you can find her sharing new and vintage content on her YouTube channel and being Guinny to her eleven grandchildren. Ever grateful for all she has been blessed with, Paula and her family continue to give back to the community. Paula, a board member of the Bethesda Home for Boys, also works tirelessly for America's Second Harvest. In 2012, Paula launched The Bag Lady Foundation, supporting issues of hunger that affect women and families across the country.

Paula Deen Paula Deen is a Savannah-based restaurateur, author, and television personality. Her cooking and businesses have won both praise and criticism, especially after her past use of racial slurs and promotion of high-sugar recipes while being diabetic became known. Paula Ann Hiers was born in Albany on January 19, 1947, to Corrie and Earl Hiers. She spent her early childhood at River Bend, a small resort in Dougherty County owned by her grandparents. Her father worked at a car dealership, and her mother and grandmother ran the restaurant at River Bend. Although the young Paula often wanted to help in the kitchen, her mother found the child's presence disruptive due to Paula's need to ""be in control of [the] pots."" She graduated from Albany High School in 1965 and at age eighteen married Jimmy Deen, whom she met in high school. Her first son, Jamie, was born in 1967, followed three years later by another son, Bobby. Paula DeenPhotograph from Paula Deen Soon after the birth of her second son, Deen began to suffer from depression and fear of public places, and she often used cooking as a way to cope with her illness. In 1989 she and her husband divorced, and she moved with her sons to Savannah. There she opened a catering business called The Bag Lady, where Deen and her sons distributed bagged sandwiches and desserts in downtown Savannah. When this proved a successful venture, she chose to open a restaurant. In 1990 Deen's first restaurant, The Lady, opened in a Best Western hotel in Savannah. In 1996 she opened a larger restaurant, The Lady and Sons, after the lease for The Lady's space expired. The restaurant proved successful, serving southern favorites like hoecakes, fried chicken, and fried green tomatoes. The following year she published her first cookbook and sold it on QVC, a home-shopping television network. While becoming well known outside the Southeast through her cookbook, her restaurant benefited from increased Savannah tourism resulting from John Berednt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. In 1999 Deen met Gordon Elliott, a television personality and producer, who brought her on as a guest on his cooking show. She began appearing on several Food Network shows, and in November 2002 her own show, Paula's Home Cooking, premiered on the Food Network. She later starred in two additional Food Network series, Paula's Party and Paula's Best Dishes, and focused on recipes inspired by traditional southern foods that could be made at home with readily available ingredients. The Lady and Sons RestaurantImage from Steven Miller Deen married Michael Groover, a harbor-ship pilot from Savannah, in 2004. The next year she began publishing the magazine Cooking with Paula Deen, and in March 2008 she launched a line of housewares and cooking appliances. In 2007 her memoir, Paula Deen: It Ain't All about the Cookin', reached number two on the New York Times best-seller list for nonfiction, and she received two Emmy Awards for Paula's Home Cooking. Deen faced controversy when she revealed in 2012 that for three years she had suffered from diabetes, even while promoting high fat and sugary foods. Saying that she had always counseled moderation, Deen opined, ""I'm your cook, not your doctor."" In 2013, a white former employee of Lady and Sons sued Paula Deen for racial and sexual discrimination. In a deposition, Deen admitted to using racial slurs in the past. Consequently the Food Network pulled her television shows and retailers stopped selling her products. A federal judge eventually threw out the racial discrimination charge and the parties settled the lawsuit out of court, but Deen's behavior left a cloud of controversy for years to come. With the increasing popularity of on-demand content, Deen began a digital subscription service, the Paula Deen Network, in 2014. She continues to publish additional cookbooks and operates a handful of restaurants.

Paula Deen (born January 19, 1947, Albany, Georgia, U.S.) is an American chef who popularized the cuisine of the American South through restaurants, cookbooks, and television programs. Aside from her culinary creations, her appeal lay largely in her rags-to-riches story, her distinctive Southern accent, and her warm and welcoming public persona. Deen grew up in southwestern Georgia, not far from the site where her ancestors had operated a cotton plantation in the mid-19th century. She spent her early childhood at a small resort owned by her maternal grandparents, but she left at age six, when her parents purchased a gas station and souvenir shop in Albany and the family moved into the back of the shop. Deen remained close to her grandparents, however, and it was from her grandmother that she learned the style of cooking that would eventually make her famous. Shortly after Deen graduated from Albany High School in 1965, she married her high-school sweetheart, Jimmy Deen (divorced 1989). Her father died in 1966 and her mother four years later. In addition to the challenge of raising two young boys, cumulative adversity--including being robbed at gunpoint while working as a bank teller--were overwhelming for Deen, and she became psychologically unstable, experiencing frequent panic attacks and increasingly debilitating bouts of agoraphobia. After moving to Savannah in 1987, she recovered enough to secure a job in a hospital. To supplement her meagre income, in 1989 she launched The Bag Lady, a side business making ""lunch and love in a bag"" for her colleagues at the hospital. Deen's lunch business expanded, and by 1991 she had opened a sit-down restaurant at a Savannah hotel. The restaurant, called The Lady, flourished, and in 1996 she moved it to a larger space. The restaurant reopened as The Lady & Sons, marking the integral role that Deen's two boys played in the operation. The Lady & Sons quickly developed a large and dedicated customer base, which prompted Deen to publish The Lady & Sons Savannah Country Cookbook (1998), a compilation of some of her favourite recipes. Release of the cookbook catalyzed Deen's rise as a celebrity chef. Marketed through a home-shopping television channel, it sold nearly 70,000 copies in just one day and ultimately led to the 2002 premiere of Paula's Home Cooking, Deen's own cable-television show on the Food Network. Viewers were captivated as much by Deen's unsophisticated and self-deprecating sense of humour, her nonjudgmental attitude, and her all-around rustic charm as they were by her cooking, and the show not only shot to the top in the network's ratings but also earned Deen an Emmy Award in 2007 for outstanding lifestyle host. The success of Paula's Home Cooking led Deen to create and host two more cooking shows for the Food Network: Paula's Party (2006-08) and Paula's Best Dishes (2008-13). When she was not on camera, Deen continued to publish cookbooks, open restaurants, and diversify her business. By 2012 she had released more than a dozen cookbooks, had launched the magazine Cooking with Paula Deen, and had published her life story, Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin' (2007; with Sherry Suib Cohen), which became a New York Timesbest seller. She also opened a number of restaurants at casinos across the country and developed lines of kitchenware and food products. Throughout her career Deen was recognized as a maven of sugar- and fat-laden comfort foods, among the most notorious of which was a hamburger topped with a fried egg and bacon, sandwiched between two glazed doughnuts. Consequently, she became the target of some sharp criticism when she announced in 2012 that she had been diagnosed with type II diabetes. Neither her condition nor the criticism did much to change her culinary ways, however. She addressed her illness mostly through medication and moderation. Deen drew even more pointed criticism in 2013, when, in the course of a lawsuit filed by a former employee, she confessed to using racist language, condoningderogatory humour, and allowing pornography at her place of business. The lawsuit made numerous allegations against Deen and Bubba Hiers, her brother; a judge later dismissed the racial discrimination claims, ruling that the former employee did not have legal standing to sue. Although Deen posted a lengthy and effusive apology on the YouTube video-sharing Web site, the Food Network announced that it would not renew her contract after June of that year. Deen subsequently looked to rehabilitate her public image. In 2015 she appeared as a contestant on the popular television series Dancing with the Stars and released the cookbook Paula Deen Cuts the Fat: 250 Favorite Recipes All Lightened Up (written with Melissa Clark). In 2016 she debuted a new TV show, Positively Paula, which included cooking and interviews; it aired on various cable channels. That year she also unveiled a clothing line. Though Positively Paula lasted only one season, Deen continued her comeback with the release of the cookbook Paula Deen's Southern Baking (2019).",5,1,3,1

Five years later they changed their name to the Boston Red Sox. In 1903 the Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates battled for bragging rights in the very first baseball World Series. ""Batter up!"" the umpire called at the very first World Series on October 1, 1903, with more than 16,000 people in the stands. Cracker Jacks were sold by the dozens and fans packed wooden bleachers with pennants and souvenir programs in hand. The Pittsburgh Pirates' right fielder, Jimmy Sebring, hit the first home run in World Series history, leading his team to victory in the first game, but the Boston Americans eventually won the eight-game series 5-3. More than 100,000 spectators flooded Pittsburgh and Boston for the games, overwhelming public transportation-many walked miles to avoid trolley delays. Hotels were jammed with people who'd crossed several states to attend. For residents of the host cities the World Series overshadowed anything else going on.

The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the ""Fall Classic"", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States. A total of 120 World Series have been contested through 2024, with the AL champion winning 68 and the NL champion winning 52. The New York Yankees of the AL have played in 41 World Series, winning 27 – the most championship appearances and most victories by any MLB team. The Dodgers and the Yankees are tied for the most losses with 14 each. The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 championships, the most among NL clubs and second-most all-time behind the Yankees. The Dodgers have represented the NL the most in the World Series with 22 appearances. The Seattle Mariners are the only MLB franchise that has never appeared in a World Series; the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays, and Colorado Rockies have all played in the Series but have never won it, with the Padres and the Rays appearing twice. The Los Angeles Angels and Washington Nationals are the only teams who have won their only World Series appearance, and the Toronto Blue Jays and Miami Marlins are the only teams with multiple World Series appearances with no losses. The Toronto Blue Jays are the only franchise from outside the United States to appear in and win a World Series, winning in 1992 and 1993. The Houston Astros are the only franchise to have represented both the NL (2005) and the AL (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022), winning the Series in 2017 and 2022. The 1919 and 2017 World Series were both marred with cheating scandals: the Black Sox Scandal and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. The most recent World Series champions are the Los Angeles Dodgers. The last team to repeat as champions were the Yankees in 2000. Two World Series matchups (in 1982 and 2005) have no possibility of a rematch due to one of the contending teams switching to the opposing league – the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the NL in 1998, and the Houston Astros moved to the AL in 2013. == Results == Numbers in parentheses in the table are World Series appearances as of the date of that World Series, and are used as follows: Winning team and Losing team columns indicate the number of times that team has appeared in a World Series as well as each respective team's World Series record to date.

The First World Series As Major League Baseball is about to embark on their annual World Series, many sports fans may not realize that the first use of the term ""World Series"" was in reference not to baseball but to professional football. In 1902, the manager of Madison Square Garden, a New York promoter named Tom O'Rourke, was looking for a way to fill his arena on New Year's Day, 1903. He came up with the idea of playing a series of indoor football games, the winner of which, he declared, would be the world champion. O'Rourke promoted his tournament, which kicked off on Dec. 28, 1902, as pro football's ""World Series."" Thus, strictly speaking, America's first ""World Series"" was actually a pro football game. Ten months later, on Oct. 1, 1903, MLB played its first modern World Series game. Major League Baseball's first World Series game occurred on Oct. 1, 1903 when the Boston Pilgrims defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-3 in Boston, Mass. The game occured ten months after pro football's ""World Series."" The best pro football teams in 1902 had been the Phillies and Athletics of Philadelphia, the Stars of Pittsburgh, and the Red and Blacks of Watertown, New York. Unfortunately, O'Rourke was unable to get any of those teams to participate in his hastily scheduled tournament. However, players from both the Phillies and Athletics got together and formed their own team that became known as the ""New York"" team. The other teams accepting O'Rourke's invitation included the Orange, New Jersey Athletic Club; the Warlow Athletic Club; the New York Knickerbockers; and the Syracuse Athletic Club. O'Rourke's plan was to set up a schedule that would allow the favored hometown Knickerbockers to play the neighboring Orange Athletic Club in the final Championship Game. This, he thought, would guarantee the best attendance and resulting gate receipts on New Year's Day. Hoping to eliminate the weaker teams early, O'Rourke scheduled the Syracuse and ""New York"" teams to open the series and play pro football's first indoor game on Dec. 28. O'Rourke incorrectly assumed ""New York"" would defeat Syracuse and then the stronger Knickerbockers would defeat both the weak Warlow Athletic Club and then the ""New York"" team. What the promoter did not count on was Syracuse loading up with ""ringers"" from other teams, including the entire backfield of the powerful Watertown Red and Blacks. The bolstered Syracuse A.C. not only won its opener 5-0, but also clobbered the Knickerbockers and Orange Athletic Club by 36-0 scores and claimed the 1902 indoor World Championship.

63,what is malaysian currency?,Malaysian Ringgit (MYR),Malaysian ringgit,"The Malaysian ringgit (; plural: ringgit; symbol: RM; currency code: MYR; Malay name: Ringgit Malaysia; formerly the Malaysian dollar) is the currency of Malaysia. Issued by the Central Bank of Malaysia, it is divided into 100 cents (Malay: sen). == Etymology == The word ringgit is an obsolete term for ""jagged"" in the Malay language. The word was originally used to refer to serrated edges. The first European coins to circulate widely in the region were Spanish ""pieces of eight"" or ""cob"", their crude appearance resembling stones, hence the word jagged. The availability and circulation of this Spanish currency were due to the Spanish controlling nearby Philippines. An early printed source, the Dictionary of the Malayan Language from 1812 had already referred to the ringgit as a unit of money. In modern usage, ringgit is used almost solely for the currency. Due to the common heritage of the three modern currencies, the Singapore dollar and the Brunei dollar are also called ringgit in Malay (currencies such as the US and Australian dollars are translated as dolar), although nowadays the Singapore dollar is more commonly called dolar in Malay. To differentiate between the three currencies, the Malaysian currency is referred to as Ringgit Malaysia, hence the official abbreviation and currency symbol RM. Internationally, the ISO 4217 currency code for Malaysian ringgit is MYR. The Malay names ringgit and sen were officially adopted as the sole official names on 28 August 1975. Previously they had been known officially as dollars and cents in English and ringgit and sen in Malay, and in some parts of the country this usage continues. In the northern states of Peninsular Malaysia, denominations of 10 sen are called kupang in Northern Malay and called pua̍t (鏺/鈸) in Penang Hokkien which is thought to be derived from the Thai word baht. e.g. 50 sen is lima kupang in Malay or 'samah' in the Kelantan dialect and gōo-pua̍t (五鏺/鈸) in Hokkien. The Tamil speaking communities in Malaysia use veḷḷi (வெள்ளி) meaning ""silver"" in Tamil to refer to ringgit, while for sen, the word kācu (காசு) is used, from which the English word ""cash"" is derived. == History == === Before independence === The Spanish-American silver dollar brought over by the Manila galleons was the primary currency for international trade, used in Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries; it was eventually called the ringgit. The various dollars introduced in the 19th century were itself derived from the Spanish dollar: the Straits dollar, Sarawak dollar and the British North Borneo dollar. From these dollars were derived their successor currencies the Malayan dollar and the Malaya and British Borneo dollar, and eventually the modern-day Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar. === After independence (1967–1997) === On 12 June 1967, the Malaysian dollar, issued by the new central bank, Central Bank of Malaysia, replaced the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par. The new currency retained all denominations of its predecessor except the $10,000 denomination, and also brought over the colour schemes of the old dollar. Over the course of the following decades, minor changes were made to the notes and coins issued, from the introduction of the M$1 coin in 1967, to the demonetization of RM500 and RM1,000 notes in 1999. As the Malaysian dollar replaced the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par and Malaysia was a participating member of the sterling area, the new dollar was originally valued at 8+4⁄7 dollars per 1 British pound sterling; in turn, £1 = US$2.80 so that US$1 = M$3.06. In November 1967, five months after the introduction of the Malaysian dollar, the pound was devalued by 14.3% from US$2.80 to US$2.40, leading to a collapse in confidence for the sterling area and its demise in 1972. The new currency stayed pegged to the U.S. dollar at US$1 = M$3.06, but earlier notes of the Malaya and British Borneo dollar were devalued from US$2.80 to US

Costa Rica Money The Costa Rican unit of currency is the colon. Named after Christopher Columbus, the first European to visit Costa Rica, the colon has a value that fluctuates between 500-550 colones per 1 US dollar. The cost of travel in Costa Rica is higher than other countries in Central America, but is still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe. History The Spanish introduced the first real currency to Costa Rica in the 16th century. Known as pesos, these coins were originally manufactured in Spain and transported to Costa Rica, but were later minted in Peru after gold and silver mines were discovered here. The two original denominations - the golden ""Escudo"" and the silver ""Real"" - were used for exchanges, with the ""Real"" being used for most daily transactions. Following Costa Rica's independence from Spain in 1821, it joined the Federal Republic of Central America and adopted the Republic's currency. After Costa Rica separated from the Republic in 1838, its currency again changed. The change was reflected in the coin design, which used coffee and tobacco symbols, the two main exports at the time. When the Republic of Costa Rica was officially declared in 1848, new symbols - a flag and a shield - were adopted and have continued to be used since. In 1993, Costa Rica began printing the so-called ""new currency,"" which cost much less to manufacture. Still in use today, this currency consists of golden coins made of bronze coated steel, in addition to 5 and 10 colones coins made from aluminum. Stability The only thing you need to worry about during your holiday in Costa Rica is enjoying yourself. Not only is the Costa Rican government stable, the nation is known as the most stable country in Central and Latin America. This stability carries over into Costa Rica's economy; you will have no difficulty accessing money in Costa Rica upon your arrival or departure. Practical Matters US dollars are widely accepted in Costa Rica, especially at upscale hotels and restaurants--some places even list their prices in US dollars to make it easier for international travelers. For smaller services (including local meals or public transportation), be prepared to pay with colones. Costs Budget travelers can survive on around US$30 to US$40 a day. This covers basic transportation, lodging, and food. Rooms in budget hotels usually run around US$10 to US$20 per person and may include private or shared bathrooms. Meals at local restaurants (called sodas) usually go for around US$3 to US$4. Midrange travelers usually spend US$50 to US$100 per person per day. Hotels in this range are more comfortable and offer a good list of amenities; these usually go for around US$30 to US$80 a night. Restaurants in this category offer meals for US$5 to US$10. High-end travelers will find a number of upscale hotels and restaurants in Costa Rica. Nicer hotels start at around US$90 and are often found in more developed areas, although there are some impressive eco-lodges in remote destinations. Meals at the best restaurants begin at around US$20. Hotels are generally more expensive during the dry season (December to April) and holidays, including Christmas, New Years, and Semana Santa. Banks, ATMs and Money Colones come in paper denominations of 1.000, 2.000, 5.000, 10.000, 20.000, and 50.000. Coins come in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500. Older coins are silver and slightly larger than the newer versions. Most of the newer coins are gold-colored, except for the 5 and 10 colones coins, which are silver. Expect little difficulty when it comes to exchanging money in Costa Rica. All banks will exchange US dollars and many will exchange British pounds or euros. Travelers checks can be cashed at banks or exchange bureaus for a commission of 1% to 3%. Some hotels accept travelers checks for payment, but many do not. ATMs (known as cajeros automaticos) are widely available in Costa Rica. Some banks charge a fee for using an ATM abroad, so check with your bank before traveling to Costa Rica. Credit cards are widely accepted at midrange and upscale hotels and restaurants. Most credit cards include a transaction fee for international purchases. Credit cards are widely accepted throughout the country, but there will still be occasions when only cash will do. We recommend reading our article ""Are Credit Cards Accepted?"" to learn when and where credit and debit cards are appropriate. This article will also help you better determine how much cash you may need throughout your trip. Taxes and Tipping There is a 13% tax on all purchases in Costa Rica, including souvenirs, food, and hotels. Hotels add an additional 3% tourist surcharge and most restaurants include a 10% gratuity fee. You are not obligated to tip on top of this, but it's good practice to do so, because the 10% fee is split among many people. If you want to tip your waiter directly, leave more money on the table. You may want to tip other people while in Costa Rica, including maids, bellhops, or drivers. Tips for these services usually range from US$1 to US$10 a day. Taxi drivers do not expect a tip.

Malaysian Ringgit Currency MYR The Malaysian ringgit (MYR), unofficially called the Malaysian dollar, is the official currency of Malaysia. The Malaysian ringgit is divided into 100 sen. Economy Malaysia has the fourth largest economy in Southeast Asia. Malaysia's economy previously relied on the production of agricultural export commodities and minerals. Currently, it relies on industry and services sectors, accounting for almost 37 percent and over 56 percent of GDP. The country's economy experienced an economic revolution in the late 20th century. Malaysia is the world's second largest exporter of palm oil products. History In 1967, the central bank of Malaysia issued the Malaysian dollar, replacing the British Borneo and Malayan dollar at par. In 1975, the official name of Malaysia's currency was changed to 'ringgit'. In 1998, the Malaysian ringgit was pegged to the US dollar at the exchange rate of 1 USD = 3.80 MYR. In 2005, the peg was abandoned and the ringgit became a floating currency.",5,1,5,5
64,who do pagans worship?,"Pagans often worship deities from various pantheons, such as Greek, Roman, Norse, Celtic, and others. Some pagans also practice polytheism, animism, or pantheism, which can involve a variety of spiritual beliefs and practices.",Odin,"Paganism Introduction Paganism has its roots in the pre-Christian religions of Europe. Its re-emergence in Britain parallels that in other western countries, where it has been growing rapidly since the 1950s. The social infrastructure of paganism reflects the value the pagan community places on unity in diversity; it consists of a network of inter-related traditions and local groups served by several larger organisations. In Scotland the Pagan Federation acts as an educational and representative body. Pagans understand deity to be manifest within nature and recognise divinity as taking many forms, finding expression in goddesses as well as gods. Goddess worship is central in paganism. Pagans believe that nature is sacred and that the natural cycles of birth, growth and death observed in the world around us carry profoundly spiritual meanings. Human beings are seen as part of nature, along with other animals, trees, stones, plants and everything else that is of this earth. Most pagans believe in some form of reincarnation, viewing death as a transition within a continuing process of existence. Attitudes to healthcare staff and illness Most pagans have a positive attitude towards healthcare staff and are willing to seek medical help and advice when sick Religious practices Most pagans worship the old pre-Christian gods and goddesses through seasonal festivals and other ceremonies. Observance of these festivals is very important to pagans, and those in hospital will generally wish to celebrate them in some form. As there are many diverse traditions within paganism, you should ask individual patients if they have any special requirements. Some pagans may wish to have a small white candle or a small figure of a goddess on their locker. Diet For ethical reasons, most pagans strongly prefer foods derived from organic farming and free-range livestock rearing, while many are vegetarian or vegan. Fasting There are no organised fast days, but some pagans choose to fast in preparation for Ostara (spring equinox). Washing and toilet Washing and toilet present no unusual problems for pagans Ideas of modesty and dress There are no particular points to be noted in this area and few pagans would object to being examined by doctors of the opposite sex. Death customs Most pagans believe in some form of reincarnation, viewing death as a transition within a continuing process of existence. Pagans accept death as a natural part of life and will wish to know when they are dying so that they may consciously prepare for it. Individuals may ask for rituals (soon as possible after death) Birth customs As paganism celebrates life, birth is viewed as sacred and empowering. Pagan women will wish to make their own informed decisions regarding prenatal and neonatal care. Family planning Pagans will generally plan pregnancies, and use contraception as appropriate. Paganism emphasises women's control over their own bodies, and the weighty decisions relating to abortion are seen as a personal matter for the woman concerned, who will be supported in the choices she makes. Blood transfusions, transplants and organ donation Most pagans would have no objection to blood transfusions and may receive transplants or donate organs for transplant.

Modern paganism, also known as contemporary paganism and neopaganism, spans a range of new religious movements variously influenced by the beliefs of pre-modern peoples across Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. Despite some common similarities, contemporary pagan movements are diverse, sharing no single set of beliefs, practices, or religious texts. Scholars of religion may study the phenomenon as a movement divided into different religions, while others study neopaganism as a decentralized religion with an array of denominations. Adherents rely on pre-Christian, folkloric, and ethnographic sources to a variety of degrees; many of them follow a spirituality that they accept as entirely modern, while others claim to adhere to prehistoric beliefs, or else, they attempt to revive indigenous religions as accurately as possible. Modern pagan movements are frequently described on a spectrum ranging from reconstructive, which seeks to revive historical pagan religions; to eclectic movements, which blend elements from various religions and philosophies with historical paganism. Polytheism, animism, and pantheism are common features across pagan theology. Modern pagans can also include atheists, upholding virtues and principles associated with paganism while maintaining a secular worldview. Humanistic, naturalistic, or secular pagans may recognize deities as archetypes or useful metaphors for different cycles of life, or reframe magic as a purely psychological practice. Contemporary paganism has been associated with the New Age movement, with scholars highlighting their similarities as well as their differences. The academic field of pagan studies began to coalesce in the 1990s, emerging from disparate scholarship in the preceding two decades. == Terminology == === Definition === There is ""considerable disagreement as to the precise definition and the proper usage"" of the term modern paganism. Even within the academic field of pagan studies, there is no consensus about how contemporary paganism can best be defined. Most scholars describe modern paganism as a broad array of different religions, not a single one. The category of modern paganism could be compared to the categories of Abrahamic religions and Indian religions in its structure. A second, less common definition found within pagan studies – promoted by the religious studies scholars Michael F. Strmiska and Graham Harvey – characterises modern paganism as a single religion, of which groups like Wicca, Druidry, and Heathenry are denominations. This perspective has been critiqued, given the lack of core commonalities in issues such as theology, cosmology, ethics, afterlife, holy days, or ritual practices within the pagan movement. Contemporary paganism has been defined as ""a collection of modern religious, spiritual, and magical traditions that are self-consciously inspired by the pre-Judaic, pre-Christian, and pre-Islamic belief systems of Europe, North Africa, and the Near East."" Thus it has been said that although it is ""a highly diverse phenomenon"", ""an identifiable common element"" nevertheless runs through the pagan movement. Strmiska described paganism as a movement ""dedicated to reviving the polytheistic, nature-worshipping pagan religions of pre-Christian Europe and adapting them for the use of people in modern societies."" The religious studies scholar Wouter Hanegraaff characterised paganism as encompassing ""all those modern movements which are, first, based on the conviction that what Christianity has traditionally denounced as idolatry and superstition actually represents/represented a profound and meaningful religious worldview and, secondly, that a religious practice based on this worldview can and should be revitalized in our modern world."" Discussing the relationship between the different pagan religions, religious studies scholars Kaarina Aitamurto and Scott Simpson wrote that they were ""like siblings who have taken different paths in life but still reta

Paganism (from Latin pāgānus 'rural', 'rustic', later 'civilian') is a term first used in the fourth century by early Christians for people in the Roman Empire who practiced polytheism, or ethnic religions other than Judaism. In the time of the Roman Empire, individuals fell into the pagan class either because they were increasingly rural and provincial relative to the Christian population, or because they were not milites Christi (soldiers of Christ). Alternative terms used in Christian texts were hellene, gentile, and heathen. Ritual sacrifice was an integral part of ancient Greco-Roman religion and was regarded as an indication of whether a person was pagan or Christian. Paganism has broadly connoted the ""religion of the peasantry"". During and after the Middle Ages, the term paganism was applied to any non-Christian religion, and the term presumed a belief in ""false gods"". The origin of the application of the term ""pagan"" to polytheism is debated. In the 19th century, paganism was adopted as a self-descriptor by members of various artistic groups inspired by the ancient world. In the 20th century, it came to be applied as a self-descriptor by practitioners of modern paganism, modern pagan movements and Polytheistic reconstructionists. Modern pagan traditions often incorporate beliefs or practices, such as nature worship, that are different from those of the largest world religions. Contemporary knowledge of old pagan religions and beliefs comes from several sources, including anthropological field research records, the evidence of archaeological artifacts, and the historical accounts of ancient writers regarding cultures known to Classical antiquity. Most modern pagan religions existing today express a worldview that is pantheistic, panentheistic, polytheistic, or animistic, but some are monotheistic. == Nomenclature and etymology == === Pagan === It is crucial to stress right from the start that until the 20th century, people did not call themselves pagans to describe the religion they practiced. The notion of paganism, as it is generally understood today, was created by the early Christian Church. It was a label that Christians applied to others, one of the antitheses that were central to the process of Christian self-definition. As such, throughout history it was generally used in a derogatory sense. The term pagan derives from Late Latin paganus, revived during the Renaissance. Itself deriving from classical Latin pagus which originally meant 'region delimited by markers', paganus had also come to mean 'of or relating to the countryside', 'country dweller', 'villager'; by extension, 'rustic', 'unlearned', 'yokel', 'bumpkin'; in Roman military jargon, 'non-combatant', 'civilian', 'unskilled soldier'. It is related to pangere ('to fasten', 'to fix or affix') and ultimately comes from Proto-Indo-European *pag- ('to fix' in the same sense): The adoption of paganus by the Latin Christians as an all-embracing, pejorative term for polytheists represents an unforeseen and singularly long-lasting victory, within a religious group, of a word of Latin slang originally devoid of religious meaning. The evolution occurred only in the Latin west, and in connection with the Latin church. Elsewhere, Hellene or gentile (ethnikos) remained the word for pagan; and paganos continued as a purely secular term, with overtones of the inferior and the commonplace. Medieval writers often assumed that paganus as a religious term was a result of the conversion patterns during the Christianization of Europe, where people in towns and cities were converted more easily than those in remote regions, where old ways tended to remain. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not have occurred to Romans during Early Christianity",2,2,3,1
65,who plays king julian madagascar?,"Conrad Vernon plays King Julian in Madagascar. However, if you're asking about the voice actor for King Julian, it would be Danny Jacobs.",Sacha Baron Cohen,"The Penguins of Madagascar is an American animated television series produced by DreamWorks Animation and co-produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio. It stars nine characters from DreamWorks' animated film Madagascar: the penguins Skipper (Tom McGrath), Rico (John DiMaggio), Kowalski (Jeff Bennett), and Private (James Patrick Stuart); the lemurs King Julien (Danny Jacobs), Maurice (Kevin Michael Richardson), and Mort (Andy Richter); and the chimpanzees Mason (Conrad Vernon) and Phil. Characters new to the series include the otter Marlene (Nicole Sullivan) and a zookeeper named Alice (Mary Scheer). It is the first Nicktoon co-produced with DreamWorks Animation. The series was executive-produced by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle, who were the creators of the animated series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (a spin-off of Pixar's Toy Story franchise) and Disney Channel's Kim Possible. The pilot episode, ""Gone in a Flash"", aired as part of ""Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend"" on Friday, November 28, 2008, and The Penguins of Madagascar became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere. Although the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, The Penguins of Madagascar does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place ""not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe"". At the end of 2010, the show was the number two animated program on television among kids age 2–11 and in basic cable total viewers. The show received praise for its animation quality, regarded as very good for the time. In December 2014, DiMaggio stated that the show ended production. The show's executive producers, Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, later served as executive consultants for DreamWorks' next Madagascar spin-off series (All Hail King Julien). == Plot == The Penguins of Madagascar is a spin-off of the Madagascar films. The series follows the adventures of four penguins: Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico, who perform various commando-like missions to protect their home in the Central Park Zoo. The penguins often have to deal with problems caused, or made worse, by their zoo neighbors, King Julien XIII (a ring-tailed lemur), Maurice (an aye-aye), and Mort (a mouse lemur). == Episodes == == Characters == The Penguins of Madagascar features the four penguin characters from the Madagascar franchise, as well as the two chimpanzees and the three lemurs. Characters new to the franchise include Marlene the otter and Alice the zookeeper, among others. Tom McGrath, John DiMaggio, Andy Richter, and Conrad Vernon reprise their roles as Skipper, Rico, Mort, and Mason respectively. All four of the penguin characters are designed differently in the cartoon than they are in the movie to make them more distinguishable and easier to tell apart. Skipper's head is flatter in the series; Kowalski is taller; Rico has an unexplained scar over his mouth, a double chin, and a feathery Mohawk; and Private is shorter, younger, and rounder. Their personalities and abilities were also exaggerated. The texture of the characters was also changed to be better suited for television work. === Main === Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath) is the leader of the penguins. He devises tactics and gives orders. Arrogant, calculating, strict, energetic, paranoid, short-tempered and nearly unflappable, Skipper's raving paranoia and tendency to view even the most ordinary activities as a military operation, combined with his experience in covert ops, has driven him to prepare for nearly any situation, no matter how bizarre or unlikely. He is also the second-youngest of the penguins. It is revealed in the episode ""Needle Point"" that Skipper is afraid of needles. McGrath reprises his role from the films. Kowalski (vo

What We Do in the Shadows is an American comedy horror mockumentary fantasy television series created by Jemaine Clement, first broadcast on FX on March 27, 2019. The series follows four vampire roommates on Staten Island, and stars Kayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, Harvey Guillén, Mark Proksch, and Kristen Schaal. Based on the 2014 New Zealand film of the same name, written by Clement and Taika Waititi, it is the second television series in the franchise. The show was renewed for a sixth and final season, that premiered on October 21, 2024. It has been critically acclaimed (particularly for its cast and writing) and nominated for 29 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2020, 2022, and 2024, for its second, third and fifth season, respectively. == Premise == Traditional vampires Nandor, Laszlo, and Nadja, together with energy vampire Colin Robinson, share a Staten Island residence, maintained by Nandor's familiar Guillermo. The vampires routinely clash with the modern world, other supernatural beings, and/or each other, while Guillermo earnestly endeavors to balance his loyalty to Nandor with his desire to become a vampire, complicated by his ancestry as a descendant of vampire hunter Van Helsing. == Cast and characters == === Main === Kayvan Novak as Nandor the Relentless – Once the bloodthirsty leader of the fictional kingdom of Al-Quolanudar in southern Iran and a warrior serving the Ottoman Empire. At age 760, he is the oldest vampire and the self-proclaimed leader of the group, leading him to frequently calling house meetings for frivolous discussions. Although he genuinely cares for his human familiar Guillermo, he has difficulty expressing it. Nandor is also quite naïve to the ways of modern society and humans, which often results in Guillermo becoming frustrated with him. Matt Berry as Leslie ""Laszlo"" Cravensworth – A 310-year-old vampire from British nobility who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. A pansexual and former porn actor who is often preoccupied with sexual thoughts, he enjoys sexual encounters with both Nadja and Nandor. He also enjoys making topiary sculptures of vulvas in the yard, including those of his wife and mother. Natasia Demetriou as Nadja of Antipaxos – A 500-year-old Greek Romani vampire who turned Laszlo into a vampire and later married him. She is frequently frustrated with her male housemates and nostalgic about her human life. She has entertained an affair with a reincarnated knight named Gregor for hundreds of years, only for him to be decapitated in every reincarnation. She later becomes manager of her own vampire nightclub. Demetriou also plays Nadja's human ghost, split from its corporeal form when Nadja was turned into a vampire, who inhabits a doll which has appeared since the second season. Harvey Guillén as Guillermo de la Cruz – Nandor's long-suffering Latino familiar. Despite his frustration with his unreasonable workload and Nandor's disregard for his mortality, he has served his master for more than a decade in the hope of being made a vampire. Guillermo discovers that he is a descendant of the famous vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing and proves to be very skilled at killing vampires, giving him conflicting feelings about his desire to become a vampire. Guillermo's skill as a vampire slayer leads to him becoming a bodyguard for Nandor, Nadja, and Laszlo. He comes out as gay to his family but reveals his desire to become a vampire at the same time, prompting Nadja to erase their memories of his confession. Mark Proksch as Colin Robinson (and Baby Colin / ""The Boy"") – An energy vampire who lives in the basement. He sustains himself by draining humans and fellow vampires of their life force by being extremely boring or frustrating. As a ""day walker"", he is not harmed by sunlight or entry into churches, and thus holds a regular job in an office where he feeds on his coworkers' frustrations. This also means that he financially supports the

CHF is the abbreviation for the Swiss franc, the official currency of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Campione d'Italia. What Is the CHF (Swiss Franc)? CHF is the abbreviation for the Swiss franc, the official legal tender of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and the Italian region of Campione d'Italia. CHF stands for Confoederatio Helvetica franc, the Latin name for the Swiss Confederation. Banknotes are issued by the Swiss National Bank and coins are issued by Swissmint, the federal mint. CHF is the only franc that's still issued in Europe after the other nations that denominated their currencies in francs adopted the euro. The Swiss franc is often called the swissie by currency market traders. It's the eighth most traded currency in the world. Key Takeaways CHF is the abbreviation for the Swiss franc, which is the official currency of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Campione d'Italia. CHF is the only franc that's still issued in Europe after the other nations that denominated their currencies in francs adopted the euro. CHF's popularity stems from its status as a perennial safe-haven currency. CHF was briefly pegged to the euro between 2011 and 2015. Understanding the CHF (Swiss Franc) The currency market, also known as the foreign exchange market or forex, is the largest financial market in the world. It boasted a daily average volume of more than $6.6 trillion in July 2024. The Swiss franc makes up a large portion of this volume. The Swiss franc's popularity stems from its status as a perennial safe haven currency. Many governments and other entities hold the currency as a buffer against instability in various types of markets and investments. The currency's stability is the result of several factors including Switzerland's history of political stability, its strong rule of law, its neutral stance regarding foreign affairs, and its Western approach to business affairs. Inflation in Switzerland has been relatively low over the years. Switzerland's government and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) are also traditionally non-interventionist. The Swiss franc is not a reserve currency, however. Foreign trade involving Switzerland is typically settled in euros or U.S. dollars, not in Swiss francs. The Swiss Franc Peg The demand for the Swiss franc as a safe haven substantially increases its value in the global foreign exchange markets. The demand for the currency as a safe haven soared in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. The SNB had USD 884 billion (CHF 797 billion) in foreign exchange reserves as of Q1 2024. Switzerland's foreign exchange reserves were equal to about 88% of its GDP at the close of 2023. The high value of the currency makes foreign goods cheap in Switzerland but it hurts domestic exporters and the Swiss tourism industry because it makes the purchase of Swiss manufactured goods and services more expensive. The flight to safety into the Swiss franc by global investors after the financial crisis was hurting Switzerland's economy because it's so heavily dependent on exports and tourism. The Swiss National Bank broke with tradition when it abandoned the float and pegged the swissie to the euro in September 2011. The fix was set at 1.2000 Swiss francs per euro. The SNB defended the peg with open market sales of the swissie to maintain the peg on the forex market. The SNB suddenly dropped the peg and allowed the currency to float in January 2015, wreaking havoc on stock and forex markets. Swiss stocks tumbled dramatically while the Swiss franc soared about 25% to 30% relative to the euro within minutes. Some investors and firms were wiped out. Economists and investors strongly criticized the SNB's actions for dropping the peg without warning and for implementing it in the first place. Its actions were also unpopular in Switzerland. Investing in the Swiss Franc The Swiss franc has long been regarded as a safe haven asset by investors due to the stability of the Swiss economy, particularly those worried about the turmoil in larger markets. It's possible to gain CHF exposure by simply buying Swiss francs but this strategy may not be ideal for retail investors because it requires them to set up a forex account. An alternative strategy would be to invest in exchange-traded funds that make investments in the Swiss currency. These funds can be traded through an ordinary brokerage account without the trouble of setting up a separate forex account. More adventurous traders can also bet on the franc through currency futures or options trades. Those who are new to the currency market might consider enlisting the advice and services of a good forex broker. Why Is the Swiss Franc a Safe Haven Currency? The Swiss franc is considered a safe haven currency due to the perceived stability of the Swiss economy and political system and a relatively low inflation rate. Political turmoil and debt crises in the European Union and the United States have led some international investors to move wealth into the Swiss currency which tends to gain value against both the euro and the dollar. Is the Swiss Franc Backed by Gold? Switzerland doesn't use the gold standard but the Swiss National Bank continues to maintain the world's seventh-largest gold stockpile as of Q1 2024 with over 1,000 tons of the precious metal. How Much Is the Swiss Franc Worth in U.S. Dollars? The Swiss franc was worth $1.1664 U.S. dollars as of October 2024. Is the Swiss Franc Stronger Than the U.S. Dollar? The U.S. dollar has steadily lost value against the Swiss franc from 2019 through 2024, making the franc a stronger currency than the dollar. The Bottom Line The Swiss franc (CHF) is considered one of the world's safest assets and is one of the most frequently traded currencies on the forex market. Investors can gain CHF exposure through ETFs, derivatives, or by simply buying Swiss francs on the forex market.

The Swiss franc, or simply the franc, is the currency and legal tender of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It is also legal tender in the Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia which is surrounded by Swiss territory. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) issues banknotes and the federal mint Swissmint issues coins. It is also designated through currency signs Fr. (in German language), fr. (in French, Italian, Romansh languages), as well as in any other language, or internationally as CHF which stands for Confoederatio Helvetica Franc. This acronym also serves as the ISO 4217 currency code, used by banks and financial institutions. The smaller denomination, a hundredth of a franc, is a Rappen (Rp.) in German, centime (c.) in French, centesimo (ct.) in Italian, and rap (rp.) in Romansh. The official symbols Fr. (German symbol) and fr. (Latin languages) are widely used by businesses and advertisers, also for the English language. According to Art. 1 SR/RS 941.101 of the federal law collection the internationally official abbreviation – besides the national languages – however is CHF, also in English; respective guides also request to use the ISO 4217 code. The use of SFr. for Swiss Franc and fr.sv. are outdated. As previously indicated Latinate ""CH"" stands for Confoederatio Helvetica; given the different languages used in Switzerland, Latin is used for language-neutral inscriptions on its coins. == History == === Before the Helvetic Republic === Before 1798, about 75 entities were making coins in Switzerland, including the 25 cantons and half-cantons, 16 cities, and abbeys, resulting in about 860 different coins in circulation, with different values, denominations and monetary systems. However, the origins of a majority of these currencies can be traced to either the French livre tournois (the predecessor of the French franc) or the South German gulden of the 17th century. The new Swiss currencies emerged in the 18th century after Swiss cantons did not follow the pace of depreciations which occurred in France and Germany. However, they mostly existed only in small change as they were little more than community currency, current in one canton but not in the other, and foreign coins like French francs and kronenthalers were more recognized as currency all over Switzerland. A high-level summary of existing currencies at the end of the 18th century is shown below, including their equivalents in terms of the French écu of 26.67 g fine silver, the South German kronenthaler of 25.71 g fine silver, and Swiss francs of 4.5 g fine silver. The livre of Bern and most western Swiss cantons like Basel, Aargau, Fribourg, Vaud, Valais, Lausanne, Neuchâtel and Solothurn originated from the French livre tournois. The livre was divided into 20 sols, 10 batzen or 40 kreuzer. After 1690, 30 Bern batzen equated to either a German Reichsthaler (25.984 g fine silver) worth 2 gulden or 120 kreuzer, or a French Louis d'Argent, equivalent to the Spanish dollar (24.93 g fine silver), worth 3 livres tournois or 60 sols. After 1726, the French écu (laubthaler) of 26+2⁄3 g fine silver was valued at 4 livres or 40 batzen (vs 6 livres tournois in France). After 1815, the German kronenthaler (Brabant thaler) of 25+5⁄7 g fine silver was valued at 3.9 livres or 39 batzen (in Neuchâtel, 4.1 livres). This livre or frank of 1⁄4 écu was the model for the frank of the Helvetic Republic of 1798–1847. Currencies identical to this standard include the Berne thaler, Basel thaler, Fribourg gulden, Neuchâtel gulden, Solothurn thaler and Valais thaler. Geneva had its own currency, the florin petite monnaie, with 3+1⁄2 florins equal to the livre courant. After 1641, the Spanish dollar was worth 10+1⁄2 florins or 3 livres. Afterwards, the écu was valued at 12+3⁄4 florins or 3+9⁄14 livres, while the kronenthaler was valued at 12+3⁄8 florins or 3+15⁄28 livres. See also Geneva thaler and Geneva genevoise. Many currencies of central and eastern Switzerland originated from the South Germa

The Swiss franc, ranked as the seventh most traded currency in the world, has gained in popularity mainly due to being a safe-haven currency. Therefore, many governments and financial institutions hold CHF as a hedge against instability in many types of investments and markets. Economy Switzerland has one of the most advanced free market economies in the world, with the service sector accounting for almost 74 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP). In 2020, Switzerland ranked as the 18th largest national economy by nominal GDP, with the country's GDP being estimated at almost US$750 billion. The service sector plays a vital role in Switzerland's economy, especially the Swiss banking industry and tourism. In 2016, it was reported that Switzerland was the world's third richest landlocked country, next to Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Approximately 28 percent of all offshore funds are banked in Switzerland. The country is neutral and not part of the European Union or EEA. It is, however, a part of the single market and has a number of bilateral treaties with the EU. Switzerland's inflation has been relatively low over the years, amounting to 0.4 percent in 2019. History In 1798, the franc was introduced and used until 1803 along with other foreign currencies, with over 8,000 different coins and banknotes in circulation. In 1848, Switzerland declared that the federal government of Switzerland would be the official issuer of money in the country. In 1850, under the Federal Coinage Act, the first Swiss franc was introduced, as the monetary unit of Switzerland, at par with the French franc. In 1865, Switzerland became part of the Latin Monetary Union, along with France, Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium, under which they agreed to adopt the gold standard, legally maintaining it until 2000. In 1945, Switzerland decided to become part of the Brent Wood System. The Swiss franc was pegged to the US dollar. From 2003 to 2006, the Swiss franc was stable against the euro (EUR). In 2015, the Swiss National Bank suddenly abandoned its peg to the euro and allowed the currency to float, causing major damage on stock and forex markets with some investors and firms being wiped out as a result of the huge sell-off. Trivia The 'swissie' is a nickname for the Swiss franc. Four national languages of Switzerland, such as Germany, Romansh, French and Italian, are featured on all Swiss franc banknotes.",5,1,5,5
67,what is the currency of brazil now?,Real,Brazilian real,"The Brazilian real (pl. reais; sign: R$; code: BRL) is the official currency of Brazil. It is subdivided into 100 centavos. The Central Bank of Brazil is the central bank and the issuing authority. The real replaced the cruzeiro real in 1994. As of April 2019, the real was the twentieth most traded currency. == History == Currencies in use before the current real include: The Portuguese real from the 16th to 18th centuries, with 1,000 réis called the milréis. The old Brazilian real from 1747 to 1942, with 1,000 réis also called the milréis. The first cruzeiro from 1942 to 1967, at 1 cruzeiro = 1 milréis or 1,000 réis. The cruzeiro novo from 1967 to 1970, at 1 cruzeiro novo = 1,000 first cruzeiros. From 1970 it was simply called the (second) cruzeiro and was used until 1986. The cruzado from 1986 to 1989, at 1 cruzado = 1,000 second cruzeiros. The cruzado novo from 1989 to 1990, at 1 cruzado novo = 1,000 cruzados. From 1990, because of the Plano Collor it was renamed the (third) cruzeiro and was used until 1993. The cruzeiro real (CR$) from 1993 to 1994, at 1 cruzeiro real = 1,000 third cruzeiros. The current real was introduced in 1994 at 1 real = 2,750 cruzeiros reais. The modern real (Portuguese plural reais or English plural reals) was introduced on 1 July 1994, during the presidency of Itamar Franco, when Rubens Ricupero was the Minister of Finance as part of a broader plan to stabilize the Brazilian economy, known as the Plano Real. The new currency replaced the short-lived cruzeiro real (CR$). The reform included the demonetisation of the cruzeiro real and required a massive banknote replacement. At its introduction, the real was defined to be equal to 1 unidade real de valor (URV, ""real value unit"") a non-circulating currency unit. At the same time, the URV was defined to be worth 2,750 cruzeiros reais, which was the average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the cruzeiro real on that day. As a consequence, the real was worth exactly one U.S. dollar when it was introduced; as of June 2024, that was equivalent to R$8,08 corrected for inflation. Combined with all previous currency changes in the country's history, this reform made the new real equal to 2.75 × 1018 (2.75 quintillion) of Brazil's original réis. Soon after its introduction, the real unexpectedly gained value against the U.S. dollar, due to large capital inflows in late 1994 and 1995. During that period it attained its maximum dollar value ever, about US$1.20=R$1. Between 1996 and 1998 the exchange rate was tightly controlled by the Central Bank of Brazil, so that the real depreciated slowly and smoothly to the dollar, dropping from near US$1=R$1 to about US$1=R$1.2 by the end of 1998. In January 1999 the deterioration of the international markets, disrupted by the Russian default, forced the Central Bank, under its new president Arminio Fraga, to float the exchange rate. This decision produced a major devaluation, to a rate of almost US$1=R$2. In the following years, the currency's value against the dollar followed an erratic but mostly downward path from 1999 until late 2002, when the prospect of the election of leftist candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, considered a radical populist by sectors of the financial markets, prompted another currency crisis and a spike in inflation. Many Brazilians feared another default on government debts or a resumption of heterodox economic policies and rushed to exchange their reais into tangible assets or foreign currencies. The crisis subsided once Lula took office, after he, his finance minister Antonio Palocci, and Arminio Fraga reaffirmed their intention to continue the orthodox macroeconomic policies of his predecessor (including inflation-targeting, primary fiscal surplus and floating exchange rate, as well as continued payments of the public debt). The value of the real in dollars continued to fluctuate but generally upwards, so that by 2005 the exchange was a little over US$1=R$2. In May 2007, for the first

Costa Rica Money The Costa Rican unit of currency is the colon. Named after Christopher Columbus, the first European to visit Costa Rica, the colon has a value that fluctuates between 500-550 colones per 1 US dollar. The cost of travel in Costa Rica is higher than other countries in Central America, but is still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe. History The Spanish introduced the first real currency to Costa Rica in the 16th century. Known as pesos, these coins were originally manufactured in Spain and transported to Costa Rica, but were later minted in Peru after gold and silver mines were discovered here. The two original denominations - the golden ""Escudo"" and the silver ""Real"" - were used for exchanges, with the ""Real"" being used for most daily transactions. Following Costa Rica's independence from Spain in 1821, it joined the Federal Republic of Central America and adopted the Republic's currency. After Costa Rica separated from the Republic in 1838, its currency again changed. The change was reflected in the coin design, which used coffee and tobacco symbols, the two main exports at the time. When the Republic of Costa Rica was officially declared in 1848, new symbols - a flag and a shield - were adopted and have continued to be used since. In 1993, Costa Rica began printing the so-called ""new currency,"" which cost much less to manufacture. Still in use today, this currency consists of golden coins made of bronze coated steel, in addition to 5 and 10 colones coins made from aluminum. Stability The only thing you need to worry about during your holiday in Costa Rica is enjoying yourself. Not only is the Costa Rican government stable, the nation is known as the most stable country in Central and Latin America. This stability carries over into Costa Rica's economy; you will have no difficulty accessing money in Costa Rica upon your arrival or departure. Practical Matters US dollars are widely accepted in Costa Rica, especially at upscale hotels and restaurants--some places even list their prices in US dollars to make it easier for international travelers. For smaller services (including local meals or public transportation), be prepared to pay with colones. Costs Budget travelers can survive on around US$30 to US$40 a day. This covers basic transportation, lodging, and food. Rooms in budget hotels usually run around US$10 to US$20 per person and may include private or shared bathrooms. Meals at local restaurants (called sodas) usually go for around US$3 to US$4. Midrange travelers usually spend US$50 to US$100 per person per day. Hotels in this range are more comfortable and offer a good list of amenities; these usually go for around US$30 to US$80 a night. Restaurants in this category offer meals for US$5 to US$10. High-end travelers will find a number of upscale hotels and restaurants in Costa Rica. Nicer hotels start at around US$90 and are often found in more developed areas, although there are some impressive eco-lodges in remote destinations. Meals at the best restaurants begin at around US$20. Hotels are generally more expensive during the dry season (December to April) and holidays, including Christmas, New Years, and Semana Santa. Banks, ATMs and Money Colones come in paper denominations of 1.000, 2.000, 5.000, 10.000, 20.000, and 50.000. Coins come in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500. Older coins are silver and slightly larger than the newer versions. Most of the newer coins are gold-colored, except for the 5 and 10 colones coins, which are silver. Expect little difficulty when it comes to exchanging money in Costa Rica. All banks will exchange US dollars and many will exchange British pounds or euros. Travelers checks can be cashed at banks or exchange bureaus for a commission of 1% to 3%. Some hotels accept travelers checks for payment, but many do not. ATMs (known as cajeros automaticos) are widely available in Costa Rica. Some banks charge a fee for using an ATM abroad, so check with your bank before traveling to Costa Rica. Credit cards are widely accepted at midrange and upscale hotels and restaurants. Most credit cards include a transaction fee for international purchases. Credit cards are widely accepted throughout the country, but there will still be occasions when only cash will do. We recommend reading our article ""Are Credit Cards Accepted?"" to learn when and where credit and debit cards are appropriate. This article will also help you better determine how much cash you may need throughout your trip. Taxes and Tipping There is a 13% tax on all purchases in Costa Rica, including souvenirs, food, and hotels. Hotels add an additional 3% tourist surcharge and most restaurants include a 10% gratuity fee. You are not obligated to tip on top of this, but it's good practice to do so, because the 10% fee is split among many people. If you want to tip your waiter directly, leave more money on the table. You may want to tip other people while in Costa Rica, including maids, bellhops, or drivers. Tips for these services usually range from US$1 to US$10 a day. Taxi drivers do not expect a tip.

This money began to be used in Rio in 1994 and was a great move as it has led to very low inflation. Exchanging Money in Rio There are several different exchange rates in Rio but three are of concern to the visitor. The official rate oversees any business deals. The tourist rate is used for tourists making purchases in the country using credit cards. Finally, the parallel rate is the rate used to convert your cash into Reals anywhere in Rio except the banks. Using Money in Rio The United States dollar is quite easy to exchange in Rio de Janeiro. Travelers are advised to either bring American dollars or travel money cards. Of course, all major credit cards are also accepted. How to Exchange Money Do not exchange money prior to arriving in Rio, as the exchange rate will probably be excessively high. Customs allows visitors to bring up to $10,000 into the country without having to declare it. This is the best way to exchange your dollars into Reals. Wait until you get to Rio as the exchange rates will probably be more favorable. Other Options for Getting Cash If you do not wish to carry a lot of cash then consider a cash card. These can also be used at ATM kiosks. These cashpoints do run out of money fairly quickly during holidays such as the Carnival so plan ahead. Most of these cash machines close at 10 pm. Getting cash in Brazil is fairly easy. There are several banks and ATMS throughout the city that can be accessed.",4,1,5,4
68,where is the mts iceplex in winnipeg?,Winnipeg,Canada,"Canada Life Centre (formerly Bell MTS Place) is an indoor arena in downtown Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is the home of the National Hockey League's Winnipeg Jets and their American Hockey League affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. The arena stands on the site of the former Eaton's Winnipeg store, and is owned and operated by True North Sports & Entertainment. The 440,000 square feet (41,000 m2) building was constructed at a cost of $133.5 million CAD. It opened on November 16, 2004, as MTS Centre, replacing the since-demolished Winnipeg Arena. It has a capacity of 15,321 for hockey and 16,345 for concerts. == History == With the bankruptcy of the iconic Eaton's retailer, the famed store originally constructed in Winnipeg, various alternative uses for the building (including residential condominiums) were suggested, but ultimately the arena was deemed to be the most viable and beneficial to the city's struggling downtown by Winnipeg Mayor Glen Murray and True North. After a small but emotional resistance to losing the Western Canadian landmark by some locals and the Save the Eaton's Coalition, which inspired a ""group hug"" of the ""Big Store"" by a reported 180 people in 2001, the store was demolished in 2002 to make way for the new entertainment complex. The arena officially opened on November 16, 2004, replacing the aging Winnipeg Arena, which had been in operation since 1955. In recognizing Eaton's history, red bricks were incorporated into the design of the arena façade, evoking the memory of their store that had once graced Portage Avenue. An original store window and Tyndall stone surround is mounted in the arena concourse to house a collection of Eaton's memorabilia. In addition, two war memorials were incorporated into the building. The Timothy Eaton statue that was once a main feature of the store is also housed on the concourse of the arena, one floor directly above where it stood on the ground floor of the original Eaton's building. Originally known as the ""True North Centre"" during its planning and construction stages, it was named MTS Centre as part of a naming rights agreement with Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS). It was renamed Bell MTS Place on May 30, 2017 following Bell Canada's acquisition of MTS. On June 15, 2021, True North announced that the naming rights had been sold to Winnipeg-based Canada Life Assurance Company under a 10-year agreement, renaming it Canada Life Centre. == Events == === Ice hockey === ==== American Hockey League ==== The AHL's Manitoba Moose were the arena's first tenant, from its opening in 2004 to 2011. The team relocated to St. John's prior to the 2011–12 AHL season to make way for the arrival of the Winnipeg Jets. The Moose returned to the MTS Centre for the 2015–16 season, making the arena the first (together with the SAP Center at San Jose) to be home to both an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. Only the lower bowl, which has a capacity of 8,812, is used for the majority of Moose home games. The arena hosted the AHL All-Star Classic on February 1, 2006, in which Team Canada defeated Team PlanetUSA, 9–4. ==== National Hockey League ==== From 1972 to 1996, the original Winnipeg Jets played home games out of the now-demolished Winnipeg Arena. Facing mounting financial troubles, the franchise relocated to Arizona after the 1995–96 NHL season and became the Phoenix Coyotes. The idea of Winnipeg one day returning to the NHL gained momentum after the MTS Centre opened. David Thomson and Mark Chipman were floated as potential owners of an NHL team, although many questions were raised about the MTS Centre's potential suitability as an NHL venue. The arena's capacity was well below that of the next-smallest NHL arena at that time, the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which sat 16,170, but lacked modern design elements. Chipman stated that the arena's current size was sufficient for an NHL team due to the unique economics of the local market. Prior to receiving an NHL team, the MTS C

Bell MTS Inc. (formerly Manitoba Telecom Services) is a subsidiary of BCE Inc. that operates telecommunications services in Manitoba. Originally established as Manitoba Government Telephones after the Government of Manitoba purchased the Manitoba assets of Bell Canada, the corporation was privatized in 1996. On March 17, 2017, Bell regained control of MTS after the Bell Canada group's holding company BCE Inc. closed its $3.9 billion acquisition of the provider and, for regulatory reasons, Bell divested approximately one third of MTS's wireless business (including subscribers and retail outlets) to Telus, and a smaller portion to the new entrant Xplornet. Under Bell ownership, Bell MTS will serve as the headquarters of Bell's telecom businesses in western Canada. == History == === Beginning === One of the first two telephone subscribers in Manitoba was Winnipeg businessman James Henry Ashdown in 1881. === Early 20th Century === MTS is the descendant company of Manitoba Government Telephones, which went into operation in January 1908 after the government of Manitoba bought Bell Canada's Manitoba operations. The Crown corporation became Manitoba Telephone System in 1921, and eventually took over all private telephone operations in the province. === 1940s === MTS announced in late 1947 that it would modernize its long-distance equipment in both Winnipeg and Brandon, using Siemens Brothers Ltd. switching equipment, to better handle routing of automatic dialing of long-distance calls by telephone operators using the currently known Area Code system. To accomplish this, MTS needed to expand its Corydon Ave. long-distance switching centre by adding four additional storeys to the building. Initial communities to be set up with the new long-distance hardware included Boissevain, Deloraine, Dauphin, Kenton, Melita, Waskada, Lyleton, Tilston, Portage la Prairie, Pierson. A trial of Mobile radio-telephone service, a technology that was developed by AT&T, took place early in 1948. An earlier trial of wireless telephone service was conducted in northern Manitoba mining towns. === 1950s === At midnight on June 21, 1959, Winnipeg was the first urban area in North America to implement the 9-9-9 emergency telephone number. Also in the late 1950s, MTS located one of its administrative offices on Empress St. near the newly opened Polo Park Shopping Centre complex. In 2000 these employees were moved to 333 Main St., commonly known as MTS Place, where 1,500 employees now work. This formed part of the Province's Downtown First strategy. === 1970s === In the late 1970s, similar to policy changes implemented by AT&T in the U.S., MTS allowed its customers to purchase their own telephone equipment and with this, provided free installation of RJ11 telephone jacks. In July 1979, MTS announced that it would be a pioneer in Telidon-based two-way electronic information services. The trial was called ""Project IDA"" and ran from 1980 to 1981. === 1980s === MTS was a pioneer in offering videotex at the commercial level. In 1981, it partnered with Infomart (then owned by the Torstar and Southam newspaper chains) to create the Grassroots service, providing information relevant to farmers on the Canadian prairies. Customers paid $47.50 per month to subscribe to Grassroots, plus connection fees to DATAPAC. Terminal equipment was manufactured by Norpak. They opened MTS Phone Centre stores in shopping malls to sell residential and business phones and services, and in 1984 opened two MTS Business Centre locations (Commodity Exchange Tower lobby and Empress St. office) to provide sales of business-level equipment. In the mid-1980s, MTS started a subsidiary known as MTX, which had invested in telecommunications in Saudi Arabia. However MTX was forced to shut down after controversy about the company back in Manitoba after MTX lost $27 million on the venture. In the late 1980s MTS launched MTS Mobility providing cellular and paging services in Manitoba after c",1,1,1,4
69,what is the state name of new york city?,New York,New York,"During its four-century history, New York City has been known by a variety of alternative names and euphemisms, both officially and unofficially. Frequently shortened to simply ""New York"", ""NY"", or ""NYC"", New York City is also known as ""The City"" in some parts of the Eastern United States, in particular, the State of New York and surrounding U.S. states. New Yorkers also use ""The City"" to refer specifically to the borough of Manhattan. == Common nicknames == The Big Apple – first published as a euphemism for New York City in 1921 by sportswriter John J. Fitz Gerald, who claimed he had heard it used the year prior by two stable hands at the New Orleans Fair Grounds because of the large prizes available at horse races in New York. Later made popular by a 1970s advertisement campaign. The Capital of the World – made popular in its application to New York by the author E. B. White in his 1948 essay Here is New York, written as construction of the United Nations headquarters began that year. Derived in turn from the Roman poet Lucan who first mocked his city of Rome as ""Caput Mundi"" in the year 61 in his work Pharsalia because of how easily it had fallen to generals the previous century. Also used with adjectives such as ""The Food Capital of the World"" or ""The Gay Capital of the World"", in reference to New York City's outsized influence upon specific cultures. The Center of the Universe – used repeatedly by New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. during his terms from 1954 to 1965, it is also commonly applied to Times Square specifically, and similarly used with adjectives such as the ""Theatrical Center of the Universe"" or ""Economic Center of the Universe"" The City So Nice They Named It Twice – a reference to ""New York, New York"" as both the city and state, spoken by Jon Hendricks in 1959 on a jazz cover of Lorenz Hart and Richard Rodgers' song ""Manhattan"" on George Russell's album New York, N.Y., and popularized by New York-based late night talk show host David Letterman, who also used the phrase ""the town so nice, they named it twice."" The City That Never Sleeps – first recorded in full in newspaper articles in the early 1900s, including in 1907 in Phoenix, Arizona in reference to New York's evening mail delivery and in 1912 in Fort Wayne, Indiana about New York's new electric and gas lighting, though also recorded in similar forms in reference to the nightlife in neighborhoods like the Bowery as early as 1892 and likely in use during the 1880s. Made popular by John Kander and Fred Ebb's song ""New York, New York"" from the Martin Scorsese 1977 film of the same name and the 1980 cover of that song performed by Frank Sinatra. The Empire City – derived from George Washington in the alleged quote ""Surely this is the seat of the empire!"" though first published in an 1836 newspaper as ""the Empire City of the New World""; also in reference to New York City's status as the most populous city in the State of New York, whose primary nickname is The Empire State. The Five Boroughs – a reference to the counties that consolidated into New York City in 1898, and often used to distinguish the city proper from Manhattan alone or the New York metropolitan area Gotham – first used by Washington Irving in his satirical periodical Salmagundi in November 1807 as an allusion to the tale of the Wise Men of Gotham, and made popular as Gotham City, the location of Batman comics, first specified in December 1940's Batman #4, written by Bill Finger The Greatest City in the World – reflective of the city's overall global prominence, and popularized by the song The Schuyler Sisters from Lin-Manuel Miranda's 2015 musical Hamilton The Melting Pot – a reference to the wide variety of ethnicities and language groups in the city, and popularized by various authors including playwright Israel Zangwill in his 1908 play The Melting Pot Metropolis – popularized as the location of Superman comics, first specified in September 1939's Action Comics #16, written by Jer

Where is New York City located? New York City is located at the mouth of the Hudson River in southeastern New York state, which is in the northeastern section of the United States. What are the five boroughs of New York City? The five boroughs of New York City are Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. Why is New York City important in the United States? New York City is the largest and most influential American metropolis and the most populous and the most international city in the country. Located where the Hudson and East rivers empty into one of the world's premier harbors, New York is both the gateway to the North American continent and its preferred exit to the oceans of the globe. What does the seal of New York City look like? The seal of the city of New York was adopted in 1686. It includes a beaver and a flour barrel, images that document the first major phase of Manhattan's economic history, the fur trade and flour exports. What is the average temperature of New York City? The average temperature of New York City is about 31 degF (0 degC) in January and about 72 degF (22 degC) in June, but recorded temperature extremes range from -15 to 106 degF (-26 to 41 degC). The annual precipitation is 44 inches (1,120 mm). Because of New York's moderate climate, the harbor rarely freezes. New York City, city and port located at the mouth of the Hudson River, southeastern New York state, northeastern U.S. It is the largest and most influential American metropolis, encompassingManhattan and Staten islands, the western sections of Long Island, and a small portion of the New York state mainland to the north of Manhattan. New York City is in reality a collection of many neighbourhoods scattered among the city's five boroughs--Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island--each exhibiting its own lifestyle. Moving from one city neighbourhood to the next may be like passing from one country to another. New York is the most populous and the most international city in the country. Its urban area extends into adjoining parts of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

Character of the city New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more images to the collectiveconsciousness of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. Its symbol is the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the arena in which Emma Lazarus's ""tempest-tost"" people of every nation are transformed into Americans--and if they remain in the city, they become New Yorkers. Why are New York City's bagels so good?Discover the chemistry of what makes the bagels in New York City taste distinctive. For the past two centuries, New York has been the largest and wealthiest American city. More than half the people and goods that ever entered the United States came through its port, and that stream of commerce has made change a constant presence in city life. New York always meant possibility, for it was an urban centre on its way to something better, a metropolis too busy to be solicitous of those who stood in the way of progress. New York--while the most American of all the country's cities--thus also achieved a reputation as both foreign and fearsome, a place where turmoil, arrogance, incivility, and cruelty tested the stamina of everyone who entered it. The city was inhabited by strangers, but they were, as James Fenimore Cooper explained, ""essentially national in interest, position, pursuits. No one thinks of the place as belonging to a particular state but to the United States."" Once the capital of both its state and the country, New York surpassed such status to become a world city in both commerce and outlook, with the most famous skyline on earth. It also became a target for international terrorism--most notably the destruction in 2001 of the World Trade Center, which for three decades had been the most prominent symbol of the city's global prowess. However, New York remains for its residents a conglomeration of local neighbourhoods that provide them with familiar cuisines, languages, and experiences. A city of stark contrasts and deep contradictions, New York is perhaps the most fitting representative of a diverse and powerful nation. The landscape The city site Central New York CityCentral New York City, depicting the borough of Manhattan southward from Central Park. Sections of the granite bedrock of New York date to about 100 million years ago, but the topography of the present city is largely the product of the glacial recession that marked the end of the Wisconsin Glacial Stage about 10,000 years ago. Great erratic boulders in Manhattan's Central Park, deep kettle depressions in Brooklyn and Queens, and the glacial moraine that remains in parts of the metropolitan area provide silent testimony to the enormous power of the ice. Glacial retreat also carved out the waterways around the city. The Hudson and East rivers, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, and Arthur Kill are, in reality, estuaries of the Atlantic Ocean, and the Hudson is tidal as far north as Troy. The approximately 600 miles (1,000 km) of New York shoreline are locked in constant combat with the ocean, as it erodes the land and adds new sediments elsewhere. Although the harbour is constantly dredged, ship channels are continually filled with river silt and are too shallow for more modern deep-sea vessels. South of the rockbound terrain of Manhattan stretches a sheltered deepwater anchorage offering easy access to the Atlantic Ocean. In 1524 the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to enter the harbour, which he named Santa Margarita, and he reported that the hills surrounding the vast expanse of New York Bay appeared to be rich in minerals; more than 90 species of precious stone and 170 of the world's minerals have actually been found in New York. Verrazzano's daring expedition was commemorated in 1964, when what was then the world's longest suspension bridge was dedicated to span the Narrows at the entrance to Upper New York Bay.

Only the third largest American port at the time of the American Revolution, New York gradually achieved trade domination and by the mid-1800s handled more than half of the country's oceangoing travelers and commercial trade. After 1900 New York was the world's busiest port, a distinction it held until the 1950s. Cargo containerization, the obsolescence of its waterfront piers, and soaring labour costs shifted business to the New Jersey side of the river after the 1960s, but at the beginning of the 21st century the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey still dominated the water trade of the northeastern United States.",1,1,5,1
70,who was jesse james killed by?,Bob Ford,The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"Jesse James Home The End of Jesse James Notorious outlaw Jesse James was shot and killed in this house on April 3, 1882. He was killed by Bob Ford, a member of the James gang, to collect a $10,000 reward offered by Governor Tom Crittenden. Jesse died at the age of 34 after living a lawless career for 16 years. He was living with his wife and two children under the assumed name of Tom Howard at the time of his death. Jesse was shot from behind while he stood on a chair to straighten a picture in his own home. After the shooting, Jesse's wife and two children and his mother, Mrs. Zerelda Samuel, spent the next two nights at Patee House, which was then called the World's Hotel. Current Influence Today the James Home is a museum dealing with the life and death of Jesse James. In 1995 forensic scientist James Starrs exhumed the outlaw's body at Kearney, Missouri, for DNA tests. The results showed a 99.7% certainty that it was Jesse James who was killed here in 1882. Artifacts from the grave are now on display including the coffin handles, a small tie pin Jesse James was wearing the day he was killed, a bullet removed from his right lung area, and a casting of his skull, showing the bullet hole behind his right ear. The Jesse James Museum is operated by the Pony Express Historical Association with all proceeds from admission charges going to help maintain both the James Home and Patee House Museum. About the James Home The James Home was originally located about two blocks north of its present location, at 1318 Lafayette Street, on a high hill overlooking Patee House. In 1939 it was moved to the Belt Highway in St. Joseph as a tourist attraction. Mr. and Mrs. Robert Keatley purchased the James Home in 1977 and donated it to the Pony Express Historical Association. The house was moved back to its original neighborhood and today it is located on the grounds of Patee House Museum.

The James–Younger Gang was a notable 19th-century gang of American outlaws that revolved around Jesse James and his brother Frank James. The gang was based in the state of Missouri, the home of most of the members. Membership fluctuated from robbery to robbery, as the outlaws' raids were usually separated by many months. As well as the notorious James brothers, at various times it included the Younger brothers (Cole, Jim, John, and Bob), John Jarrett (married to the Youngers' sister Josie), Arthur McCoy, George Shepherd, Oliver Shepherd, William McDaniel, Tom McDaniel, Clell Miller, Charlie Pitts, William Chadwell (alias Bill Stiles), and Matthew ""Ace"" Nelson. The James–Younger Gang had its origins in a group of Confederate bushwhackers that participated in the bitter partisan fighting that wracked Missouri during the American Civil War. After the war, the men continued to plunder and murder, though the motive shifted to personal profit rather than in the name of the Confederacy. The loose association of outlaws did not truly become the ""James–Younger Gang"" until 1868 at the earliest, when the authorities first named Cole Younger, John Jarrett, Arthur McCoy, George Shepherd and Oliver Shepherd as suspects in the robbery of the Nimrod Long bank in Russellville, Kentucky. The James–Younger Gang dissolved in 1876, following the capture of the Younger brothers in Minnesota during the unsuccessful attempt to rob the Northfield First National Bank. Three years later, Jesse James organized a new gang, including Clell Miller's brother Ed and the Ford brothers (Robert and Charles), and renewed his criminal career. This career came to an end in 1882 when Robert Ford shot Jesse James from behind, killing him. For nearly a decade following the Civil War, the James–Younger Gang was among the most feared, most publicized, and most wanted confederations of outlaws on the American frontier. Though their crimes were reckless and brutal, many members of the gang commanded a notoriety in the public eye that earned the gang significant popular support and sympathy. The gang's activities spanned much of the central part of the country; they are suspected of having robbed banks, trains, and stagecoaches in at least eleven states: Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and West Virginia. == History == === Origins === From the beginning of the American Civil War, the state of Missouri had chosen not to secede from the Union but neither to fight for it nor against it: its position, as determined by an 1861 constitutional convention, was officially neutral. Missouri, however, had been the scene of much of the agitation leading up to the outbreak of the war, and was home to dedicated partisans from both sides. In the mid-1850s, local Unionists and Secessionists had begun to battle each other throughout the state, and by the end of 1861, guerrilla warfare erupted between Confederate partisans known as ""bushwhackers"" and the more organized Union forces. The Missouri State Guard and the newly elected Governor of Missouri, Claiborne Fox Jackson, who maintained implicit Southern sympathies, were forced into exile as Union troops under Nathaniel Lyon and John C. Frémont took control of the state. Still, pro-Confederate guerrillas resisted; by early 1862, the Unionist provisional government mobilized a state militia to fight the increasingly organized and deadly partisans. This conflict (fought largely, though not exclusively, between Missourians themselves) raged until after the fall of Richmond and the surrender of General Robert E. Lee, costing thousands of lives and devastating broad swathes of the Missouri countryside. The conflict rapidly escalated into a succession of atrocities committed by both sides. Union troops often executed or tortured suspects without trial and burned the homes of suspected guerrillas and those suspected of aiding or harboring them. Where credentials were suspect, the acc

Main Navigation The Death of Jesse James Previous Missouri governors had tried to capture the James brothers, employing everything from reward offers to a squad of state-funded secret police. But Thomas Crittenden knew that to catch a thief, you needed a thief, and he finally brought Jesse down with the help of the outlaw's own gang. Jesse James. dead and in coffin, 1882. Library of Congress Return to Crime In the aftermath of the failed Northfield bank robbery of 1876, Frank and Jesse James were forced to hide under assumed names in Tennessee. Jesse chafed at the lack of attention, and in 1879 he decided to return to crime. His old comrades were almost all gone, so Jesse recruited a new gang, men who craved the spoils of banditry but had never served as Confederate guerillas with Jesse and therefore had no deep loyalty to him. Jesse also faced another problem. He had long seen himself as a heroic Southern outlaw, still fighting against Northern oppressors more than a decade after the Civil War was done. But by 1880 Reconstruction was long gone, and Jesse's side had won the peace. Ex-Confederates dominated Missouri politics, and, having won their battle for power, they no longer needed someone who wore a Ku Klux Klan mask while robbing trains. Stripped of this support, Jesse was vulnerable to a concerted push from a determined foe. Crittenden Plots Thomas Crittenden had served with the Missouri State Militia and fought bushwackers during the war. But Missouri's new governor also had practiced law with an ex-Confederate general, and he had no desire to re-fight 15-year-old battles. What Crittenden did want was an end to Jesse's outlaw antics. He railed against the bandit in his 1881 inaugural speech. ""Missouri cannot be the home and abiding place of lawlessness of any character,"" he declared. And Crittenden went right to work rooting out that lawlessness. The legislature had previously made a gesture of support for the James brothers and had limited government reward offers to $300. Crittenden's first step was a July 1881 meeting with various railroad and express company leaders, at which Crittenden persuaded them to sponsor a $10,000 reward each for the capture of Frank and Jesse James. The reward drew the attention of 21-year-old Bob Ford, whose brother Charlie was a member of Jesse's new gang. Bob convinced Charlie that they should kill Jesse and collect the money. Ford Strikes Acting through their sister Martha Bolton, the Fords made contact with Governor Crittenden, and Bob met with him on January 13, 1882. They reached a deal: if the Fords killed Jesse, they would receive both the reward money and a pardon for their crimes. Meanwhile, some of Jesse's other gang members had been killed or captured in the face of Crittenden's relentless pursuit. Infighting and paranoia had also taken its toll on the gang: Dick Liddil, with Bob Ford's help, shot one gang member -- Jesse's cousin -- and Jesse himself shot Ed Miller, and scared away Jim Cummins after he began to suspect Cummins of treachery. Ironically, Jesse thought the Ford brothers were the last two people he could trust. So that March the outlaw invited Bob and Charlie to move into his new home in St. Joseph. The Fords said yes -- and waited for their chance to strike. They knew they couldn't do anything while Jesse was armed; he'd get the drop on them for sure. So they watched and waited until finally, on April 3, Jesse was moving in and out of his house and got so hot that he took off his coat. Afraid of being spotted with his pistols, he removed them as well. Then Jesse stepped on a chair in his living room and reached forward to dust a picture. Bob and Charlie drew their weapons, and Bob put a bullet in the back of Jesse's brain. Profiters Bob and Charlie Ford were convicted of murder, but Governor Crittenden pardoned them and got the railroad companies to pay out the reward. As it turned out, the Ford brothers weren't the only ones who profited from Jesse's death. A promoter offered his mother Zerelda $10,000 for the body; she refused, but later charged visitors a quarter each to take pebbles from his grave. Jesse's son wrote a book about him, and some 40 years after his death, Jesse's children even appeared in a movie about him called ""Jesse James Under the Black Flag."" Now Streaming The little-known story of a deadly 1898 race massacre and coup d'etat in Wilmington, North Carolina, when white supremacists overthrew the multi-racial government of state's largest city through a campaign of violence and intimidation. When Black neighborhoods across America erupted in violence in the summer of 1967, President Johnson appointed a commission to find the cause for the unrest. Their findings offered an unvarnished assessment of American race relations.",1,1,5,5

Costa Rica Money and Tipping Customs in Costa Rica Exchanging Currency, ATM Machines, Using US Cash & Advice on Tipping Explore Vacation Options Colones to Dollars The official currency of Costa Rica is the Colon. Colones consist of colorful bills that depict some of Costa's Rica's most beautiful animals- these being sharks, monkeys, sloths and butterflies. They come in the amounts of 1000, 2000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 colones. The exchange rate between the dollar (USD) and the colon is always fluctuating and is currently around 612 colones to the dollar. For the most current exchange rates, check the site of the Central Bank of Costa Rica. The Colon The Costa Rica currency, the Colon, was named after Christopher Columbus, or Cristobal Colon. New colorful waterproof bank notes were released between 2012 and 2014. The bills come in denominations of C/1,000, C/2,000, C/5,000, C/10,000, and C/20,000, C/50,000 with coins of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 Colones. You might also notice that the bills are different sizes. That is actually a unique feature that helps people who are blind differentiate between each bill. The money system in Costa Rica is not too confusing, so you shouldn't be too worried about trying to figure it out. A quick reference point is that everything is a multiple of five. 500 colones is equivalent to approximately one dollar. Make sure you check the exchange rate before your trip. The exchange rate may go up or down, but it won't make that much difference in everyday purchases. 1,000 colones is about $2, 4,000 colones ~ $8, 5000 ~ $10. 10,000 colones ~ $20. A good trick is to look at the first number and double it to equal the approximate dollar amount. Using US Cash US dollars are widely accepted in Costa Rica. Bring smaller bills like $1, $5, $10 and $20 bills. The bills will need to be in good condition as they will not be accepted if they are ripped or torn. The larger the bill, the more perfect it needs to be. Bills larger than $20 are difficult and might have to be changed at a bank. You will most likely receive your change in the local currency: colones. Euros are not widely accepted in Costa Rica. Exchanging US Dollars To Costa Rican Money When you arrive, you may exchange your money for official currency at any local bank. Some upscale hotels will also exchange money for their guests. Note that you will get a more favorable exchange rate from banks. Do not exchange money inside the airport. You'll see money changing kiosks as soon as you exit the baggage claim area, but it's best to walk right past it. The exchange rate at the kiosks in the Costa Rica airports is notoriously terrible. You can also exchange money at your own bank in your home country for a good rate. They will just have to order the colones, so plan on exchanging your money a few weeks ahead of time. Travel Tip: If you are making a smaller purchase at a local convenient store or soda, try not to pay with large colones bill. For example, if you want to buy a Casado for 2,500 colones, try not to us a 20,000 colones bill. Ticos tend to get annoyed because they don't want to break that much change. Although if you are insistent, they will usually help you. Travel Tip: Most places accept credit and debt cards. Just check with your bank about any possible fee you might have to pay to use your card internationally. Travel Tip: Leave your travelers checks at home. They are not as widely accepted as cash or credit cards. The main color of the 1,000 colones banknote is red. On the reverse, you can see a dry forest with a Guanacaste tree, a white-tailed deer and a Costa Rican nightblooming cactus. The observe shows Braulio Carrillo Colina, who was the Head of State of Costa Rica between 1835-1837 and 1838-1842, as well as the 1840-1842 Costa Rican coat of arms. The main color of the 2,000 colones banknote is blue. On the reverse, you can see a coral reef, a bull shark, a red cushion sea star and a slimy sea plume. The observe shows Mauro Fernandez Acuna, who was a lawyer and politician, as well as the Colegio Superior de Senoritas. The main color of the 5,000 colones banknote is yellow. On the reverse, you can see a mangrove swamp, a white-headed capuchin monkey, a mangrove crab and a red mangrove. The observe shows Alfredo Gonzalez Flores, who served as President of Costa Rica from 1914 to 1917, as well as the Banco International de Costa Rica building in San Jose. The main color of the 10,000 colones banknote is green. On the reverse, you can see a rainforest, a brown-throated sloth, a cup fungi and a eriopsis orchid. The observe shows Jose Figueres Ferrer, who served as President of Costa Rica on three occasions, as well as the Abolition of the Army. The main color of the 20,000 colones banknote is orange. On the reverse, you can see Paramo, a volcano hummingbird, a sunflower and coffee plants. On the observe, you can see Carmen Lyra, the first prominent female Costa Rican writer, as well as an outline of Costa Rica and a rabbit stroking a wolf from Lyra's ""Cuentos De Mi Tia Panchita"" (Tales of My Aunt Panchita). The main color of the 50,000 colones banknote is violet. On the reverse, you can see a cloud forest, a parasol mushroom, a bromelia flower and a morpho butterfly. It shows Ricardo Jimenez Oreamuno, who served as president of Costa Rica three times and also served the Supreme Court in San Jose. ATM Machines You may get local colones using your ATM card. It's important that you know the exchange rate before you do this. You should check with your bank regarding their policy for foreign ATMs, fees, limitations, etc. Local ATM's fees will vary, just like at home. Be mindful when using ATMs and make sure that you are in a safe area. Some ATMs will let you withdraw dollars, but not all of them. Credit Cards Credit cards are widely accepted by most businesses in Costa Rica. Contact your credit card providers to let them know you are traveling and ask them if any foreign transaction fees apply. Sometimes you will get a better price paying in cash rather than use a card, especially when you are negotiating. Cost of Traveling in Costa Rica Costa Rica is regularly voted as the happiest country on earth, based on its life expectancy, lifestyle, values, and its environmental sustainability. Every year more people come to visit this little country for its natural beauty and eco-friendly attitude. Those who travel on a shoestring budget can survive on $50 a day. Top-notch hotels can charge up to $500 or more. Prices of luxury hotels and tours are in dollars, and dollars are widely accepted, but it is useful to have some Colones on hand. Shopping in Costa Rica Shopping for clothes and food in Costa Rica is not as cheap as you might expect. Most prices are actually similar to prices in the US or UK. Clothes, in particular, are expensive in Costa Rica. Supermarkets now offer a wider selection of local and imported food and a good selection of wine. It is significantly more costly than in the US, especially for imported items. Shopping in the center of San Jose, like at the Central Market on Avenida Central, is cheaper than in the flashy Malls of the Suburbs, and this is also where you will find typical artisans and souvenirs. The most economical places to shop for fresh foods, meats, fish fruits, and vegetables are at outdoor ferias (farmer's markets). They are usually open in the mornings on weekends. We suggest having a meal at a traditional soda too! Sodas are ""mom and pop shops"" that traditionally serve the famous Costa Rican casado, or ""married man's meal."" It's served with chicken, fish, pork or beef, rice, beans, salad, plantains and fresh juice! Bring cash because it will be cheap! Tipping in Costa Rica Unfortunately, there is no definitive guide for Tipping in Costa Rica, and it's a hard topic as people have different opinions on when and how much to tip. Tips are appreciated, and your guides and drivers will be used to receiving them from tourists. Drivers & Guides: Depending on how much time and effort each guide or driver spent with you, $10, $20 or $40 is certainly appreciated based on the level of service you feel you received. Taxis: Tipping taxi drivers are almost unheard of, but if you feel the urge, it will be well received! Restaurants: Leaving a tip is not required for servers. Restaurants in Costa Rica add a 10% service charge to your bill. If you receive exceptional service, we recommend leaving an additional 10%. Hotels: For porters, 500 colones (about $1) per bag is a fair gratuity. Above all, we hope that you find this information useful and that you are getting excited about your upcoming trip to Costa Rica.

Whether it's about your budget, expenses, or the cost of living, learning about Chinese currency (coins and notes, payment, withdrawals, etc.) ensures a more relaxing and less expensive stay. In this guide, you'll learn everything you need to know about currency in China so that you can set off to the Middle Kingdom with complete confidence. What is the official Chinese currency? The official currency of China is the renminbi, more often called the yuan. It is issued by the People's Bank of China: Its symbol is ""Y="" or ""Yuan ,"" Its abbreviation is RMB or CNY, 1 euro is worth around79 yuan, Each yuan can be divided into 10 jiao (cents). In everyday speak, it's common to hear the names kuai and mao used to refer to yuan and jiao, respectively. Chinese currency also used to include the fen, corresponding to 0.1 jiao or 0.01 yuan. However, while the fen was long used, it disappeared from circulation because of its low value. Note that while the yuan is the official currency of China, it is not used in Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, which have their own currencies: The Hong Kong dollar (HKD$), The Macau pataca (MOP), The Taiwanese dollar (NT$). What are the coins and banknotes in Chinese currency? The currency in China consists of various coins and banknotes, ranging from 1 jiao to 100 yuan: There is little circulation of counterfeit currency in China, but it still happens, especially with banknotes. To verify the authenticity of a Chinese currency note, look in the light to see if the watermark of the People's Bank of China is present on the front of the note, on the left side. You can also run your finger over Mao's collar -- if it is rough, the note is genuine. Send money to China with Western Union How can you pay in China? There are several ways to pay in China: cash, bank card and mobile payment. A few years ago, mobile payment via WeChat Pay or Alipay replaced cash as the most popular payment method throughout the country. Let's go over the details of these different payment methods: Cash: Although used slightly less nowadays, cash remains very common for everyday spending. However, merchants are often unable to give change and therefore no longer accept cash. If you have 100 renminbi in Chinese currency, consider going to a supermarket to get smaller denominations. Bank card (credit or debit): Rarely used by Chinese people for everyday things. However, international credit cards are still accepted in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, as well as at major hotels and in luxury boutiques, and are convenient for booking domestic flights or train journeys. Mobile payments: Now the preferred payment method for Chinese people, whether they're buying or selling, they can be used everywhere by scanning a merchant's QR code. There are two major mobile payment apps: WeChat Pay and Alipay. To create an account, simply provide a non-Chinese phone number, your passport information and bank card details. Mobile payments are the best option in China, as they are accepted everywhere and make transactions much easier. They also allow you to travel without having to carry a lot of money. However, it's still recommended to have small Chinese currency notes on you, in case you need it. And, whatever your payment method, learn to haggle in Chinese stores and markets. To negotiate well, it's important to choose the store wisely, know the approximate price of the item you want, and the maximum price you're willing to pay. Above all, always be respectful. Can you pay in euro in China? With some exceptions, you can't pay in either euro or dollars in China. The vast majority of businesses only accept yuan.

72,what currency can you use in barbados?,Barbados Dollar,Barbadian dollar,"What Currency does Barbados use? Barbados uses the Barbados Dollar as its official currency, often represented by the symbols ""BBD"" or ""$"". Distinctive in its design and reflecting the island's rich history and culture, the Barbadian Dollar is the primary mode of transaction for goods and services on the island. Yet, for the convenience of travellers, the US Dollar is also widely accepted in most establishments, making financial transactions in Barbados both straightforward and flexible for visitors from around the globe. History of Barbadian Currency Long before the advent of the Barbadian Dollar, the island, under British colonial rule, relied on the British pound sterling. Coins from Britain, and even Spanish dollars, circulated the island, reflecting its position in global trade and colonial dynamics. In the early 1970s, in a move echoing its growing autonomy and post-independence identity, Barbados transitioned to its own currency. This shift was symbolic of breaking away from colonial economic ties and embracing a more localized economic structure. The look of the Barbadian Dollar, from banknotes to coins, captures the essence of the island. From national heroes to iconic landmarks and endemic species, the currency serves as a miniature canvas of Barbadian heritage. The flying fish, for instance, featured on one of the coins, isn't a nod to the island's marine life but it's also the Barbados national dish. What denominations of the Barbados dollar can you get? Coins: These come in denominations of 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, and 1 dollar. Notably, the coins are distinct in size and design, making them easily distinguishable. As mentioned earlier, the imagery ranges from the iconic flying fish to the national coat of arms. Banknotes:Barbadian banknotes are vibrant and varied, available in denominations of $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Each note carries a unique color and features national heroes, historical events, or significant landmarks, adding a touch of Barbadian essence. What is the Exchange rate of the Barbados dollar? The value of the Barbadian Dollar is pegged to the US Dollar, with an exchange rate of 1 US Dollar to 2 Barbadian Dollars. This means its value doesn't fluctuate wildly based on global currency market shifts but rather remains steady relative to the US Dollar. Can you use USD in Barbados? Most establishments in Barbados, especially those frequented by tourists such as hotels, restaurants, and popular attractions, accept the US Dollar. While the official exchange rate is approximately 2 Barbadian Dollars to 1 US Dollar, it's not uncommon for businesses to round it for simplicity. For instance, some places might offer a 1:2 rate, while others might round it off to a slightly less favourable rate for tourists. It's always beneficial to ask beforehand. While US Dollars are widely accepted, the change is often given in Barbadian Dollars. This system helps ensure that the local currency remains in circulation and also acquaints tourists with the local denominations. Does that mean Barbados is a US territory? Barbados is not a U.S. territory, and it does not use the U.S. dollar as its official currency. Barbados is an independent nation and its official currency is the Barbadian dollar (BBD). The misconception might arise because the U.S. dollar is widely accepted in many Caribbean countries due to the region's heavy reliance on tourism, but each country maintains its own government and monetary system. Using ATMs and Credit Cards in Barbados ATMs are conveniently located across the island and there are several around the location of Villa Sunnyside Barbados. Most of these machines are linked to well-established local and international banks, such as CIBC FirstCaribbean, Scotiabank, and Republic Bank. However, while ATMs do provide easy access to the local Barbadian Dollars, be mindful of potential transaction fees. These can arise from the local bank in Barbados or from your home bank, especially if they charge for international withdrawals. You'll be pleased to know that major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, enjoy widespread acceptance. Larger establishments, such as hotels, restaurants, and upscale stores, readily accept these cards. Smaller shops might have a preference for cash transactions. This makes having a modest amount of Barbadian Dollars in your pocket a prudent choice. The final word about Barbados currency The Barbadian Dollar is set at a stable rate of 1 US Dollar to 2 Barbadian Dollars. This makes it easy for visitors and businesses alike. This fixed rate eliminates the guesswork often associated with fluctuating exchange rates, ensuring that travellers can budget and plan their expenditures with confidence. Visitors will find that many establishments readily accept both currencies. Whether you're dining out or shopping in Bridgetown, both Barbadian and US dollars are typically welcomed. Credit and debit cards are widely accepted across the island, making electronic payments convenient for tourists and residents.

They will arrange all the necessary permits and licences as well as insurance and your vehicle will normally be delivered to and collected from your accommodation. There is a good network of paved roads but, like most Caribbean islands, the signposting system leaves much to be desired. Please note that driving is on the LEFT. You will need to take your UK driving licence with you! Buses and taxis There is a comprehensive bus service which covers the whole island with a flat fare of about Bds$1.50 for all journeys. Although cheap, buses are crowded during the rush hours. There are many licensed 'mini vans' that run around the island picking up tourist and locals. You will recognise them by their ZR license plate. They have a few fixed schedules but there are many of them and service is frequent. The rate is Bds$1.50 and is not recommended for the nervous passenger as ZRs stop frequently, often abruptly and move quickly to pick up the maximum paying passengers in the shortest time!

Electricity Barbados runs on 115 volts/frequency 50 Hz - this is less than the UK which runs on 240 volts. You will need a universal adapter plug for all electrical appliances as plugs and sockets are US flat 2-pin style. You should also check the label on the appliance in case you also require a voltage converter. Some appliances never need a converter.

This is common for chargers of tablets/laptops, photo cameras, mobile phones, toothbrushes, etc. How to get to Barbados We can offer flights to Barbados as part of a package holiday with the following airlines: Medical facilities All hotels will offer necessary assistance and direct you to the nearest doctor, clinic or specialist. Pharmacies are very well stocked with all usual medications. There is a large and high-quality hospital in Bridgetown. We advise you to take sufficient supplies of any medication that you normally take and as always, make sure you have adequate medical insurance before you travel. Mosquitoes and other pests While Barbados has very few creepy crawlies and the like, tropical places do produce tropical insects, and mosquitoes can be a nuisance. We suggest you take precautions by using repellent creams and sprays both day and night. Water The water is of excellent quality and is fine for drinking from the tap. Locally bottled water is also available. Safety and security Barbados is a very friendly and relatively safe place, but it makes sense to take reasonable precautions against crime wherever you travel. Be particularly careful on isolated beaches and when visiting the island's fun 'jump-up' street parties. Crime of any sort against tourists is very rare, but we still advise visitors to use taxis after dark whenever possible. Restaurants will always offer help with calling taxis to and from their premises. We also advise all our clients travelling anywhere in the world to consult the Foreign Office website for detailed up-to-date travel advice. Visit www.fco.gov.uk for information and feel free to talk to our staff for clarification of any information the web page contains. Telephones Most UK mobile phones will work in Barbados however it is advisable to check with your service provider before travelling to confirm roaming facilities and texting options.

Calls and messages to the UK can then be made using apps such as WhatsApp or Messenger. Tax and tipping There is 15% VAT on meals at hotels and restaurants. Tipping is customary for good service (10% tip is appreciated) but check if the service charge has already been included on restaurant bills. Churches There are a number of different churches from all major denominations on Barbados and visitors are welcome at services. Valuables Lock up as you would at home. Most hotels have safety deposit boxes and we advise against taking valuables to the beach or leaving possessions on view in your hire car. The police emergency number is 911 in Barbados.

Is there any advantage to using Barbados dollars in cash transactions instead of using US dollars? Or is it just straight up 2 for 1 no matter where you go? Can you just overpay on the local buses with US dollars, and not ask for change? Thanks. You're a visitor in a foreign country..........Businesses do accept US funds, you will get change in Bds funds. Why risk insulting bus drivers who then have to or someone has to count the money exactly. Or tell you they need exact change or you can't get on the bus. The Barbados dollar is ""pegged"" to the US dollar. Do yourself a favour and don't add to what can be seen as a negative image of another tourist, this one is from where...oh yeah. Believe me, I'm being very polite, some might not be if you aggravate them in your transactions. Angie, we take a little US with us (for the taxi from the airport) and use what Bajan was left from last trip then use the ATMs to get more Bajan or exchange Canadian at the bank (no fees and best rate, bring your passport). There are RBC, CIBC and Scotia banks there so their ATMs are available. We have never bought Bajan dollars in Canada. Angie, you don't have to stand in line at a bank, you can use your Cdn. debit card to withdraw money at a bank ATM. Of course, you will receive Barbados $. But do bring some US $ for the first few days until settled in. I thought post #2 was a little on the harsh side. I am the original poster, and would normally do all cash transactions in the local currency. I'm pretty well traveled, but I've never seen an official taxi rate schedule use anything other than local currency. That taxi schedule and many restaurant sites list prices in USD. This is unusual. That is why I asked. NC regarding 4 above 'no fees and best rate' - is the official FX rate USD-BBD not the same everywhere, i.e. 1.975:1? That was what the hotel front desk always charged me. Would it be better at the bank? FWIW, I do travel with a good amount of USD (not CAD) and then accumulate BBD as I get change during my stay. The USD spending includes airport taxi, restaurants, and our first big grocery shop. Massy does the FX conversion at the official rate I believe. Restaurants use 2:1 in most instances based on my experience. Elena it is confusing at first. Barbados businesses should just list in their currency, as many travelers now use currency conversion apps, especially in SE Asia, Europe and Latin America. I bring enough USD including smaller denominations for arrival etc. Head to any bank asap and convert larger bills to the local currency as needed. I hardly ever use my debit card on the island or when travelling (Fraud Conscious), as most places now take credit cards. Many vendors are cash only, so try to use Barbados $ at these places. Do keep your excess USD in the hotel/room safe. Don't be flashy with money or jewelry. Enjoy Barbados! Up what I was meaning was a better rate than buying Bajan in Canada or even from an ATM in Barbados.. If you convert at a bank there is no service charge where if you buy Bajan in Canada there is. AFAIK the Bank of Barbados publishes the rate relative to the CDN dollar every morning. That is the rate you will get at a bank.

Preparing The Trip: Currency Barbados Currency When planning your Barbados vacation remember that the Barbados Dollar is converted at the rate of $1.98 BDS to $1.00 U.S. The Barbados Dollar is fixed to the U.S Dollar and does not fluctuate. Its rate to other currencies fluctuates daily based on their fluctuations relative to the U.S. Dollar. On your travels around Barbados you will find that US currency is accepted across the island, and most stores and restaurants accept major credit cards. Of course most Barbados hotels and other lodgings also accept these various forms of payment. Barbados banknotes are issued in the following denominations: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 Dollars. In 2022 the Central Bank of Barbados released an attractive new series of bank notes in these same denominations. Barbados coins are issued as 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents and 1 Dollar.",5,1,5,4
73,where did tony gonzalez play college basketball?,Cal,"University of California, Berkeley","Tony Gonzalez Tony Gonzalez was one of the greatest two-sport athletes to ever come through the University of California, Berkeley. As a Golden Bear, he starred as a basketball player despite constantly playing against bigger players and became an All-American as a football player. Beyond Berkeley, he became one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history, becoming a dominant force with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Atlanta Falcons, but his story as a great player truly began to blossom as a Golden Bear. Early Years Anthony David ""Tony"" Gonzalez was born on February 27, 1976 in Torrance, California. Early on, he wasn't too sure of his athletic ability against others. One day as a freshman, everything clicked in a drill on the practice field and he truly began to grow as a player. He realized that timidity could be fatal to an athletic career and that he couldn't afford to back down from anyone. From that day on the practice field and for the rest of his life, Tony Gonzalez was determined to never back down from anyone and to pursue his dreams with gusto and vigilance. He starred in basketball and football at Huntington High School. As a senior, he was named an All-American as both a tight end and a linebacker after recording 62 passes for 945 yards and 13 touchdowns. On the basketball court, Gonzalez was named both the Orange County and Sunset League MVP after averaging 26 points per game. Following his senior year, Gonzalez was shared the Orange County High School Athlete of the Year honors with Tiger Woods. Due to his many athletic exploits, Tony Gonzalez accepted a scholarship to Cal. Freshman Year When Tony Gonzalez arrived in Berkeley in the fall of 1994, he immediately expected greatness from himself. Unfortunately for him, Cal's offense at the time was not very reliant on the tight end position and as a freshman he didn't see as much playing time as he would in subsequent years. He caught just eight passes for 62 yards and one touchdown that year as the Golden Bears went 4-7. Things were a bit different in basketball. Given more of an opportunity to contribute as a forward, Gonzalez averaged 7.1 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. Unfortunately, these contributions did little to help the team win games as they finished 13-14 while finishing last in the Pac-10. However, better days were ahead for Tony Gonzalez and the California Golden Bears basketball and football programs. Sophomore Year The 1995 football season was statistically better for Tony Gonzalez as he caught 37 passes for 541 yards and two touchdowns. However, the players couldn't adapt to coach Keith Gilbertson's approach and finished the year 3-8. When the season was finished, Gilbertson was fired after four years at the helm. The 1995-1996 basketball season was a turnaround year for the program as they finished the year with a 17-11 record, losing to Iowa State 74-64 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Gonzalez played slightly better than the year before but still struggled against bigger competition. He finished the year averaging 5.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. Junior Year Until his junior year, the Golden Bears had not featured a very good football team. When Steve Mariucci was hired as Cal's new head coach in 1996, Tony Gonzalez's football aspirations truly took off. He flourished in the newly installed West Coast offense, catching 44 passes for 699 yards and five touchdowns. As a result of his athletic feats, Tony Gonzalez was named first-team All-Pac-10 and was a consensus All-American. To make things even better, the team enjoyed a 6-6 finish, their first non-losing season since 1993. Though they lost the Aloha Bowl to Navy 42-38, the future looked bright for the program as long as both Mariucci and Gonzalez stayed. However, frustrated with the size disadvantage in basketball for his height of 6'5"", Tony Gonzalez saw a brighter future in football and decided to turn pro. Mariucci was soon hired by the San Francisco 49ers and Cal's program quickly reverted to its losing ways, winning just three games in 1997. After such an accomplished junior year on the football team, the basketball season figured to be a letdown for Tony Gonzalez. He was training for the NFL Combine and had a bright future ahead of him on the gridiron and it would have been deemed admissible that he loaf through his final year on Cal's basketball team. He didn't see it that way, averaging 6.8 points and 4.6 rebounds on a team bound for the NCAA Tournament. The Golden Bears finished the year 23-9 and lost to North Carolina 63-57 in the Sweet Sixteen. Tony Gonzalez recorded four points and five rebounds in his final game as a Golden Bear. Aftermath When Tony Gonzalez's time as a Golden Bear came to an end, he was drafted 13th overall in the 1997 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. Throughout his 17 seasons in the NFL, Gonzalez constantly used his basketball skills to catch amazing passes over the outstretched arms of overmatched defenders. As one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history, Tony Gonzalez collected 1,325 receptions for 15,127 yards and 111 touchdowns, all records for his position. He retired after the 2013 season and was inducted into the Pro Hall of Fame in 2019. He now serves as a commentator and television personality.

In advance of the NBA Draft, here's a look at some college football athletes who also left an impression on the basketball court. 1 / 8 Tony Gonzalez, one of the NFL's most prolific tight ends, celebrates each touchdown with a goalpost dunk. While at Cal Gonzalez played both football and basketball. On the court, Gonzalez shot better than 50 percent from the field in his three hoops seasons and averaged 6.4 points. He played a key role in the Cal basketball team that made the Sweet 16 in 1997.",1,1,5,5
74,where is olympic national park located?,Washington,Washington,"Olympic National Park is a national park of the United States located in Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The park has four regions: the Pacific coastline, alpine areas, the west-side temperate rainforest, and the forests of the drier east side. Within the park there are three distinct ecosystems, including subalpine forest and wildflower meadow, temperate forest, and the rugged Pacific coast. President Theodore Roosevelt originally designated the park as Mount Olympus National Monument on March 2, 1909. The monument was re-designated a national park by Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 29, 1938. In 1976, Olympic National Park was designated by UNESCO as an International Biosphere Reserve, and in 1981 as a World Heritage Site. In 1988, Congress designated 95 percent of the park (1,370 square miles (3,500 km2)) as the Olympic Wilderness, which was renamed Daniel J. Evans Wilderness in honor of the former Washington state Governor and U.S. Senator Daniel J. Evans in 2017. During his tenure in the Senate, Evans co-sponsored the 1988 bill that created the state's wilderness areas. It is the largest wilderness area in Washington. == Park purpose == As stated in the foundation document: The purpose of Olympic National Park is to preserve for the benefit, use, and enjoyment of the people, a large wilderness park containing the finest sample of primeval forest of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, Douglas fir, and western red cedar in the entire United States; to provide suitable winter range and permanent protection for the herds of native Roosevelt elk and other wildlife indigenous to the area; to conserve and render available to the people, for recreational use, this outstanding mountainous country, containing numerous glaciers and perpetual snow fields, and a portion of the surrounding verdant forests together with a narrow strip along the beautiful Washington coast. == Natural and geologic history == === Coastline === The coastal portion of the park is a rugged, sandy beach along with a strip of adjacent forest. It is 60 miles (97 km) long but just a few miles wide, with native communities at the mouths of two rivers. The Hoh River has the Hoh people and at the town of La Push at the mouth of the Quileute River live the Quileute. The beach has unbroken stretches of wilderness ranging from 10 to 20 miles (16 to 32 km). While some beaches are primarily sand, others are covered with heavy rock and very large boulders. Bushy overgrowth, slippery footing, tides, and misty rainforest weather all hinder foot travel. The coastal strip is more readily accessible than the interior of the Olympics; due to the difficult terrain, very few backpackers venture beyond casual day-hiking distances. The most popular piece of the coastal strip is the 9-mile (14 km) Ozette Loop. The Park Service runs a registration and reservation program to control the usage levels of this area. From the trailhead at Ozette Lake, a 3-mile (4.8 km) leg of the trail is a boardwalk-enhanced path through near primal coastal cedar swamp. Arriving at the ocean, it is a 3-mile walk supplemented by headland trails for high tides. This area has traditionally been favored by the Makah from Neah Bay. The third 3-mile leg is enabled by a boardwalk which has enhanced the loop's accessibility. There are thick groves of trees adjacent to the sand, which results in chunks of timber from fallen trees on the beach. The mostly unaltered Hoh River, toward the south end of the park, discharges large amounts of naturally eroded timber and other drift, which moves north, enriching the beaches. Even today driftwood deposits form a commanding presence, biologically as well as visually, giving a taste of the original condition of the beach viewable to some extent in early photos. Drift material often comes from a considerable distance; the Columbia River formerly contributed huge amounts to the Northwest Pacific coasts. The smaller coastal portion of the park is s

The United States has 63 national parks, which are congressionally designated protected areas operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. National parks are designated for their natural beauty, unique geological features, diverse ecosystems, and recreational opportunities, typically ""because of some outstanding scenic feature or natural phenomena."" While legislatively all units of the National Park System are considered equal with the same mission, national parks are generally larger and more of a destination, and hunting and extractive activities are prohibited. National monuments, on the other hand, are also frequently protected for their historical or archaeological significance. Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 433 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations. A bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service ""to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."" Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS), and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR), with eight national parks in both programs. Thirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2). The national parks set a visitation record in 2021, with more than 92 million visitors. Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944, and had almost 13 million visitors in 2022. In contrast, only about 9,500 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2022. == National parks == Legend === Parks by state or territory === The following table includes the 30 states and two territories that have national parks.

75,where is president kennedy buried?,Arlington National Cemetery,Arlington National Cemetery,"""Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country."" President Kennedy's Grave in Arlington National Cemetery President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and two Kennedy infants are interred in Lot 45, Section 30, Arlington National Cemetery. The permanent graves are located about 20 feet east of the site where the President was temporarily interred on 25 November 1963. Each is marked by a simply inscribed gray slate tablet. Work on the permanent burial site began soon after the President's death and was completed on 20 July 1967. The grave area, which measures 18 by 30 feet, corresponds in size to many special lots in Arlington assigned for the burial of such other outstanding men as President William Howard Taft, Secretary of War John W. Weeks, General of the Armies John J. Pershing, and General Philip Henry Sheridan. It is surrounded by a stone grave terrace, which lies on the axis from the Lincoln Memorial across the Memorial Bridge to the Arlington House. The grave area is paved with irregular stones of Cape Cod granite, which were quarried about 150 years ago near the site of the President's home and were located by members of his family. Fescue and clover have been planted in the crevices to give the appearance of stones lying naturally in a Massachusetts field. Upon entering the general area, visitors approach the grave by way of a depressed circular walkway to a granite elliptical plaza overlooking the axial vista toward the city. The plaza is bounded by a granite wall, the relatively low top of which is tapered and inscribed with quotations from President Kennedy's Inaugural address and other speeches. From the plaza, another short flight of steps leads to the rectangular terrace and the grave plot. To provide access for handicapped persons to the President's site, a concealed greenstone walkway has been constructed on the slope north of the grave area. The Eternal Flame, lighted by Mrs. Kennedy on the day of the funeral, now burns from the center of a 5-foot circular flat granite stone located at the head of the President's grave. The burner, a specially designed apparatus which was created by the Institute of Gas Technology of Chicago, consists of a nozzle and electric ignition system. A constantly flashing electric spark near the tip of the nozzle relights the gas if the flame is extinguished by rain, wind, or accidents. The fuel is natural gas mixed with proper quantities of air to control the color and shape of the flame. The entire site, with a total area of about 3.2 acres, was set aside by the Secretary of the Army with the approval of the Secretary of Defense to honor the memory of the President. The land has been retained for the nation as a whole and has not been deeded to the Kennedy family. The steep hillside had never been considered suitable for graves or a general burial section. The area now is appropriately landscaped with new plantings mingled among some of the historic trees. While magnolias predominate, there are crab apple, willow oak, hawthorn, yellow wood, American holly, and cherry trees interspersed among flowering plants and shrubs. Some of the larger trees were selected for their grace and beauty from nearby locations and were donated to the Government by their owners. Actual costs in the immediate grave area were paid by the Kennedy family. The Government was responsible for the improvements in the surrounding area that were provided for the accommodation of the visiting public. Funds in the amount of $1,770,000 were included for this purpose in the Fiscal Year 1965 Public Works Appropriation. In addition, funds in the amount of $71,026 were expended from cemetery maintenance funds for temporary visitor control and landscape work on adjacent burial areas. The amount paid by the Kennedy family was $632,364. The architect who designed the permanent gravesite was John Carl Warnecke of John Carl Warnecke and Associates, Washington, D. C., in association with Ammann and Whitney, Structural Engineers, New York, N. Y. The Aberthaw Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts, carried out the work under the supervision of the U. S. Army District Engineer, Norfolk, Virginia. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum is one of 15 presidential libraries administered by the National Archives and Records Administration.

Search Results Interesting Facts About JFK Born May 29, 1917, John F. Kennedy was the youngest person elected President of the United States when he narrowly defeated the future president Richard Nixon. Commonly known as JFK, the Brookline, Massachusetts native is renowned for a number of exploits during his young life. These include his heroic efforts after the sinking of the PT-109 and winning the Pulitzer Prize for his book ""Profiles in Courage."" He was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald during a trip to Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. Kennedy is buried in a special grave at Arlington National Cemetery along with his wife Jackie and two of their children. The following are 10 additional interesting facts about the 35th president of the United States. Suffered Lifelong Health Problems During World War II, Kennedy was originally rejected for military service because he suffered from Addison's disease and chronic back pain. He wore corrective shoes because his legs were different lengths. He used his father's political influence to join the U.S. Navy. JFK privately used crutches. The White House swimming pool was heated to 90 degrees so that he could swim to ease his back pain. Faced Death Several Times Besides the sinking of the PT-109, JFK was given the last rites three times before he became President. Suffering poor health his entire life, JFK became extremely sick aboard the Queen Mary on a trip back from England in 1947. He experienced an extremely high fever after a trip to Asia in 1951. Kennedy became comatose after back surgery in 1954. In each case, a priest was summoned because his doctors thought that he might die. A President of Firsts Kennedy holds the record for a number of firsts. He was the first person born in the 20th century to be elected President. JFK was also the first Roman Catholic president and the first chief executive to have been a boy scout. Kennedy is the only President to have received a Purple Heart. One of Kennedy's first presidential acts was to create the Peace Corps. The Country's Wealthiest President Born to a wealthy family, Kennedy was the richest man to be elected president. He donated his congressional and presidential salaries to charities, including the Boy Scouts and the United Negro College Fund. Had Kennedy lived, he would have inherited a portion of his father's estate that was worth an estimated $1 billion. He Wanted a Cooperative Space Race After challenging NASA to put a man on the moon, President Kennedy became concerned about the potential costs. As a result, he proposed a cooperative effort between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during a speech at the United Nations as a way to prevent a duplication of effort. Kennedy had opposed the space program as a U.S. senator. Cigars First, Embargo Second In addition to ordering the failed Bay of Pigs attack against Cuba, Kennedy was able to avoid war with the Soviet Union and have nuclear missiles removed from Cuba. Before signing the long-running trade embargo against the communist-led island, Kennedy instructed his aides to purchase 1,200 of his favorite Cuban cigars. Under the relaxed trade rules enacted by President Obama, individuals can now purchase up to $100 worth of cigars per visit to Cuba. Played the Role of Movie Producer Although the first lady wanted Warren Beatty to play the part, the president used his influence to have Cliff Robertson selected for the lead role in the 1963 movie PT-109. The president was also instrumental in selecting the movie's director. Secret White House Tapes Long before Richard Nixon and Watergate made the taping of White House conversations public knowledge, Kennedy also had a secret taping system. Kennedy probably planned to use the system, which was installed in the Oval Office and Cabinet Meeting Room, to help write his future memoirs. Among the numerous historic conversations are discussions related to the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Fateful Day Although first lady Jackie Kennedy rarely traveled with the president on political trips, she accompanied him to Dallas. Abraham Zapruder captured portions of the assassination on film. In 1997, the federal government paid $16 million for the film, which is now stored in the U.S. Archives. It was the last time the Secret Service allowed a sitting president to ride in an open-top limousine. His Memory Lives On JFK visited Arlington National Cemetery in March 1963 and admired the view from the site that would be selected for his grave, which was designed by family friend John C. Warnecke. Jackie Kennedy requested the eternal flame that adorns the gravesite. Special equipment controls the color and shape of the flame that remains lit regardless of the weather. Thousands of people visit the grave every day while touring Arlington National Cemetery.",1,1,5,5
76,where do burmese cats originate from?,Burma,Asia,"Burmese (Burmese: မြန်မာဘာသာ; MLCTS: Mranma bhasa; pronounced [mjəmà bàθà]) is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Myanmar, where it is the official language, lingua franca, and the native language of the Bamar, the country's largest ethnic group. Burmese is also spoken by the indigenous tribes in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts, India's Mizoram state, and the Burmese diaspora. The Constitution of Myanmar officially refers to it as the Myanmar language in English, though most English speakers continue to refer to the language as Burmese, after Burma—a name with co-official status until 1989 (see Names of Myanmar). Burmese is the most widely-spoken language in the country, where it serves as the lingua franca. In 2019, Burmese was spoken by 42.9 million people globally, including by 32.9 million speakers as a first language, and an additional 10 million speakers as a second language. A 2023 World Bank survey found that 80% of the country's population speaks Burmese. Burmese is a tonal, pitch-register, and syllable-timed language, largely monosyllabic and agglutinative with a subject–object–verb word order. Burmese is distinguished from other major Southeast Asian languages by its extensive case marking system and rich morphological inventory. It is a member of the Lolo-Burmese grouping of the Sino-Tibetan language family. The Burmese alphabet is ultimately descended from a Brahmic script, either the Kadamba or Pallava alphabets. == Classification == Burmese belongs to the Southern Burmish branch of the Sino-Tibetan languages. Burmese is the most widely spoken of the non-Sinitic Sino-Tibetan languages. Burmese was the fifth of the Sino-Tibetan languages to develop a writing system, after Classical Chinese, Pyu, Old Tibetan and Tangut. === Dialects === The majority of Burmese speakers, who live throughout the Irrawaddy River Valley, use variants of standard Burmese, while a minority speak non-standard dialects found in the peripheral areas of the country. These dialects include: Tanintharyi Region: Merguese (Myeik, Beik), Tavoyan (Dawei), and Palaw Magway Region: Yaw Shan State: Intha, Taungyo, and Danu Arakanese in Rakhine State and Marma in Bangladesh are also sometimes considered dialects of Burmese and sometimes as separate languages. Burmese dialects mostly share a common set of tones, consonant clusters, and written script. Several Burmese dialects differ substantially from standard Burmese with respect to vocabulary, lexical particles, and rhymes. Below is a summary of lexical similarity between major Burmese dialects: ==== Irrawaddy River valley ==== Spoken Burmese is remarkably uniform among Burmese speakers, particularly those living in the Irrawaddy valley, all of whom use variants of Standard Burmese. The standard dialect of Burmese (the Mandalay-Yangon dialect continuum) originates from the Irrawaddy River valley. Regional differences between speakers from Upper Burma (e.g., Mandalay dialect), called anya tha (အညာသား) and speakers from Lower Burma (e.g., Yangon dialect), called auk tha (အောက်သား), largely occur in vocabulary choice, not in pronunciation. Minor lexical and rhyme differences exist throughout the Irrawaddy River valley. For instance, for the term ဆွမ်း, ""food offering [to a monk]"", Lower Burmese speakers use [sʰʊ́ɰ̃] instead of [sʰwáɰ̃], which is the pronunciation used in Upper Burma. The standard dialect is typified by the Yangon dialect because of the modern city's media influence and economic clout. In the past, the Mandalay dialect represented standard Burmese. The most noticeable feature of the Mandalay dialect is its continued use of the first-person pronoun ကျွန်တော်, kya.nau [tɕənɔ̀] by both men and women. In Yangon, only male speakers use the same pronoun, while female speakers use ကျွန်မ, kya.ma. [tɕəma̰]. Moreover, with regard to kinship terminology, Upper Burmese speakers differentiate the maternal and paternal sides of a family, whereas Lower Burmese speakers do not. Mon has also

The History of the Burmese Breed The Burmese breed as we know it today was developed in the United States from a single cat, Wong Mau who in 1930 was brought from the orient to New Orleans by a sailor, and given to a doctor in San Francisco. Wong Mau was described as ""a rather small cat, fine boned, but with a more compact body than that of a Siamese, with shorter tail, a rounded, short-muzzled head, with greater width between rounded eyes."" Her color was described as walnut-brown, with darker brown points. Early Burmese in the late 1930s and early 1940s caused quite a stir in the show circuit, and gained considerable popularity. A great demand for Burmese kittens developed. Breeders continued to use Siamese to increase the very limited breeding stock, thereby producing a large number of hybrids. Eventually, CFA put a stop to this, and suspended registration of Burmese in 1947. CFA ruled that there had to be three generations of pure Burmese (not hybrids) in the pedigree to be registered as ""Burmese."" This was quite disheartening to the breeders, because of the great difficulty in maintaining breeding stock. However, serious breeders took it to heart, stopped using the hybrids, and concentrated on breeding the type of cat that made the Burmese unique. Achieving the three-generation ""pure"" pedigree was slow, but finally accomplished for three cats in 1956. By late 1957, there were sufficient numbers and CFA resumed registration of the Burmese. In 1958, the newly formed United Burmese Cat Fanciers set a goal of developing a single standard for Burmese that would be accepted by all the cat fancier organizations. The standard was adopted by CFA in 1959, and, except for some refinement of wording and an addition to the ""penalize"" section, has stood unchanged since then, maintaining the vision of the Burmese as a ""round"" cat throughout the years. Burmese were highly successful in the show ring from the outset, reaching the peak of their popularity in the 1970s, when they were the third most popular breed behind Persians and Siamese. For a breed that had started in the United States with one cat in 1930, the Burmese had become solidly established as a highly popular and successful member of the cat fancy.

The Burmese cat (Burmese: ဗမာကြောင်, Băma kyaung, Thai: ทองแดง or ศุภลักษณ์, RTGS: Thongdaeng or Supphalak, meaning copper colour) is a breed of domestic cat, originating in Burma, believed to have its roots near the Thai-Burma border and developed in the United States and Britain. Most modern Burmese are descendants of one female cat called Wong Mau, which was brought from Burma to the United States in 1930 and bred with American Siamese. From there, American and British breeders developed distinctly different Burmese breed standards, which is unusual among pedigreed domestic cats. Most modern cat registries do not formally recognise the two as separate breeds, but those that do refer to the British type as the European Burmese. Originally, all Burmese cats were dark brown (genetically black), but are now available in a wide variety of colours; formal recognition of these also varies by standard. Both versions of the breed are known for their uniquely social and playful temperament and persistent vocalisation. == History == In 1871, Harrison Weir organised a cat show at the Crystal Palace, London. A pair of Siamese cats were on display that closely resembled modern American Burmese cats in build, thus probably similar to the modern Tonkinese breed. The first attempt to deliberately develop the Burmese in the late 19th century in Britain resulted in what were known as Chocolate Siamese rather than a breed in their own right; this view persisted for many years, encouraging crossbreeding between Burmese and Siamese in an attempt to more closely conform to the Siamese build. The breed thus slowly died out in Britain. Joseph Cheesman Thompson imported Wong Mau, a dark female cat, into San Francisco in 1930. Thompson considered the cat's build to be sufficiently different from the Siamese to still have potential as a fully separate breed. Wong Mau was bred with Tai Mau, a seal point Siamese, and then bred with her son to produce dark brown kittens that became the foundation of a new, distinctive strain of Burmese. In 1936, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) granted the breed formal recognition. However, due to continued extensive outcrossing with Siamese cats to increase the population, the original type was overwhelmed, and the CFA suspended breed recognition a decade later. Attempts by various American breeders to refine the unique Burmese standard persisted, however, and in 1954, the CFA lifted the suspension permanently. In 1958, the United Burmese Cat Fanciers (UBCF) compiled an American judging standard that has remained essentially unchanged since its adoption. Meanwhile, in the UK, interest in the breed was reviving. The cats that composed the new British breeding program were of a variety of builds, including some imported from the United States. By 1952, three true generations had been produced in Britain and the breed was recognised by the United Kingdom's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Since the 1950s, countries in the Commonwealth and Europe started importing British Burmese; as a result, most countries have based their standard on the British model. Historically, the two versions of the breed were kept strictly distinct genetically. European Burmese (also known as ""traditional"") were declassed as a breed by the CFA in the 1980s. The GCCF banned the registration of all Burmese imported from the United States in order to preserve the ""traditional"" bloodlines. Most modern cat registries do not formally recognise these dual standards as representing separate breeds, but those that do refer to the British type as the European Burmese. Recently, The International Cat Association (TICA) and CFA clubs have started using the American breed standard at select shows in Europe. During the early period of breed development, it became clear that Wong Mau herself was genetically a crossbreed between a Siamese and Burmese type. This early crossbreed type was later developed as a separate breed, known today as the Tonki",1,1,1,1

He made more than 500 appearances in the Football League and Premier League over an 18-year career, and represented England in international football. He also had a spell in Australia, playing for the A-League club Newcastle Jets. Born in Leicester, Heskey started his career with Leicester City after progressing through their youth system, making his first-team debut in 1995. After winning the League Cup in 1997 and 2000 he made an PS11 million move to Liverpool in 2000, which, at the time, was the record transfer fee paid by the club. At Liverpool, he won multiple honours, including the FA Cup in 2001. He moved to Birmingham City in 2004 and after their relegation from the Premier League signed for Wigan Athletic for a club record PS5.5 million fee in 2006.

He made his England debut against Hungary in a 1-1 draw in 1999. He lost his place in the squad after UEFA Euro 2004, during which he failed to shine and was the subject of much criticism. After a long lay-off from international duty, Heskey was recalled to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers in September 2007. He retired from international football following the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having attained 62 caps and scored 7 goals for his country.

The Croatia national football team (Croatian: ""Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija"" or ""Nogometna reprezentacija Hrvatske"") represents Croatia in international football matches. It is governed by the Croatian Football Federation (HNS), the governing body for football in Croatia. It is a member of UEFA in Europe and FIFA in global competitions. The team's colours reference two national symbols: the Croatian checkerboard and the country's tricolour. They are colloquially referred to as the Vatreni (Blazers) and Kockasti (Checkered Ones). Since 2024, the Vatreni have qualified for every major tournament with the exception of UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the World Cup, Croatia has finished second once (2018) and third on two occasions (1998, 2022), securing three World Cup medals. Davor Šuker won the Golden Shoe and the Silver Ball in 1998, while Luka Modrić won the Golden Ball in 2018 and the Bronze Ball in 2022. The team has reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA European Championship twice (1996, 2008). They finished second in the UEFA Nations League in 2023. Upon its admission into FIFA in 1994 ranked 125th, they ascended to third place with their debut 1998 World Cup campaign. This marked the fastest, most volatile ascension in FIFA ranking history, making them the youngest team to ever reach a Top 10 place in the World Ranking. Croatia is the second-smallest country by population (after Uruguay) and land mass (after the Netherlands) to reach a World Cup final. At the World Cup, Croatia hold records for most penalty shoot-out played (4) and won (4) and most penalties saved in a shoot-out (3), among other team records. They were named FIFA Best Mover of the Year in 1994 and 1998, thus becoming the first national team to win the award twice and also equalling joint records with France and Colombia. == History == === Official formation === The early history of Croatian football was delineated by a variety of unofficial sides as Croatia was not an independent entity until the late 20th century. Hugo Kinert first managed an unofficial side that played some international matches in 1918–19. In 1940, Jozo Jakopić led the national side representing the Yugoslav Banovina of Croatia in four friendly matches. Croatia's first official international match was a 4–0 win over Switzerland in their capital city, Zagreb, on 2 April 1940. Following the 1941 Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Germany and Italy took control of Croatia, forming the Independent State of Croatia and installing Rudolf Hitrec as an unofficial manager for two years. The side played 15 friendly matches from its re-activation in FIFA in 1941 until the end of World War II. In 1945, Croatia returned to Yugoslavia as the People's Republic of Croatia with sides active until 1956. During the nation's pre-independence, Croat footballers played for Yugoslavia at the Summer Olympics, the FIFA World Cup, and the UEFA European Championship from 1956 to 1990. Croatia debuted their modern checkered jersey against the United States on 17 October 1990, winning 2–1. Caretaker manager Dražan Jerković, led the de facto national side before their formal re-admission into FIFA on 3 July 1992, winning two more friendly games against Romania in December 1990 and Slovenia in June 1991. Stanko Poklepović took over team management and led them on an exhibition tour against Australia, before he was succeeded by Vlatko Marković in April 1993. Croatia gained admission into UEFA in June 1993, three months after qualification for the 1994 World Cup started, missing their window to enter the competition. After winning a match against Ukraine in June 1993, Marković was succeeded by Miroslav Blažević in March 1994. === Blažević period (1994–1999) === After its independence from Yugoslavia, the newly formed Croatia entered the FIFA World Rankings in 125th place in March 1994. Blažević launched Croatia's qualifying campaign for Euro 1996 with a 2–0 win over Estonia on 4 September 1994 an

St Trinian's is a 2007 British comedy film and the sixth in a long-running series of British films based on the works of cartoonist Ronald Searle and set in St Trinian's School. The first five films form a series, starting with The Belles of St. Trinian's in 1954, with sequels in 1957, 1960, 1966 and a reboot in 1980. The release of 2007, 27 years after the last entry, and 53 years after the first film, is a rebooting of the franchise, rather than a direct sequel, with certain plot elements borrowed from the first film. Whereas the earlier films concentrated on the adults, this film gives the school pupils greater prominence. St Trinian's is an anarchic school for uncontrollable girls run by eccentric headmistress Camilla Dagey Fritton (the reboot continues the tradition, established by Alastair Sim in the original film, of casting a male actor to play the female headmistress, with Rupert Everett inheriting the role). St Trinian's received mixed reviews but remains one of the highest-grossing British independent films of the last thirty years. == Plot == Annabelle Fritton, an uptight daddy's girl, unwillingly transfers to St Trinian's from the distinguished Cheltenham Ladies' College at the request of her father, Carnaby Fritton. Annabelle is resentful and insulting, telling her father that the school is ""like Hogwarts for pikeys"". She is taken around the school by Kelly Jones, the head girl, who introduces her to the various cliques within the school; Chavs, Posh Totty, Geeks, Emo and First Years. Annabelle is harassed and pranked by the girls while in the shower and a video of her running around the school naked and wet is broadcast live on the internet. After a phone argument with her father she is drafted to the hockey team when she hits her phone with her hockey stick, smashing a statue. The girls of St Trinian's are involved in business with spiv Flash Harry, who pays them to make cheap vodka. Flash is shown to be romantically interested in Kelly, who initially turns him down. The Cheltenham Ladies' College hockey team arrive at St Trinian's, along with Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites. Thwaites is shown to have romantic history with the headmistress of St Trinian's, Camilla Fritton. Annabelle is forced to face her former bullies, including captain Verity Thwaites. The hockey match is violent, ending in Kelly shooting a winning goal for St Trinian's, and she begins to fit in with the other girls. As the match is being played, Thwaites inspects the school, finding the illegal vodka-making business and the chatline being run by the Posh Totty clique. The following morning, a banker arrives at the school and serves Camilla with a foreclosure notice, as the school owes the bank in excess of £500,000 and has ignored six previous final demands. A subsequent meeting between Camilla and Carnaby is watched by the girls using hidden cameras, in which Carnaby confesses his distaste towards his daughter. Annabelle is clearly upset, despite Camilla defending her. Carnaby encourages Camilla to turn the school into a boutique hotel, telling her that ""when this school closes down, you'll have lost everything. More importantly, so will I."" Kelly and Flash work with the students to devise a plan to save the school. They must get into the final of School Challenge, a TV quiz show held in the National Gallery in London, as a cover for stealing Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring. Chelsea, Peaches and Chloe (the Posh Totty clique) are chosen as the School Challenge Team. By cheating in every round, they make it to the grand final. As the final is being filmed, Kelly, Taylor and Andrea steal the painting, with help from the Geeks, Annabelle and Camilla herself. Camilla paints an exact copy of the painting and has Flash, posing as a German art dealer, sell it to Carnaby in a black market deal. The school then receives a further £50,000 reward for returning the real painting to the National Gallery. The loans are able to be repaid and the",1,1,5,1
78,what is newcastle metro?,rapid transit system,Tyne and Wear,"The Tyne and Wear Metro is an overground and underground light rail rapid transit system serving Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, and the City of Sunderland (together forming Tyne and Wear). The owners Nexus have described it as ""Britain’s first light rapid transit system"". The system is currently both owned and operated by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive (Nexus), thus is fully under public ownership and operation. The Metro was originally conceived of during the early 1970s, incorporating much of the earlier infrastructure formerly used by the Tyneside Electrics suburban network, with some elements dating back as far as 1834. Construction work began in 1974, the majority of this activity being centred on the building of new tunnels and bridges that linked with several preexisting conventional railway lines that were converted. In parallel, a purpose-built fleet of Metrocars was procured. The initial portion of the Tyne and Wear Metro was opened during August 1980, although construction of the original network was not completed until March 1984. Early on, Metro operations were integrated with local bus services, although this practice ended with the deregulation of the buses during the late 1980s. Multiple extensions to the original network were promptly worked upon; the first of these, from Bank Foot to Newcastle Airport, was opened during November 1991. A second extension, from Pelaw to Sunderland and South Hylton, was completed in March 2002. By 2013, the network comprised a total of 60 stations (these being a mixture of underground and above-ground stations) across two lines, covering 77.5 km (48.2 mi) of track. While the Metro has largely been operated by Nexus directly, for a period between 2010 and 2017, the Metro was operated under a concession by DB Regio instead; upon the expiry of the contract, it returned to being operated by Nexus. Various improvements are underway as of 2024. During 2016, Nexus launched a programme to replace its existing rolling stock, which dates back to the 1980s. The first replacement Class 555 articulated light rail train entered passenger service on 18 December 2024. Under the Metro Flow scheme, announced in March 2020, works costing £103 million are to increase the service frequency from five to six trains per hour, reduce journey times and improve reliability levels. == History == === Predecessor === The present system uses much former railway infrastructure, mostly constructed between 1834 and 1882, one of the oldest parts being the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, which opened in 1839. During 1904, in response to tramway competition which was taking away passengers, the North Eastern Railway started electrifying parts of their local railway network north of the River Tyne with a 600 V DC third-rail system, forming one of the earliest suburban electric networks, known as the Tyneside Electrics. In 1938, the line south of the River Tyne between Newcastle and South Shields was also electrified. Under British Rail in the 1960s, the decision was made to de-electrify the Tyneside Electrics network and convert it to diesel operation, owing to falling passenger numbers and the cost of renewing end-of-life electrical infrastructure and rolling stock. The Newcastle to South Shields line was de-electrified in 1963, followed by the North Tyneside routes, in 1967. This was widely viewed as a backward step, as the diesel trains were slower than the electric trains they replaced. === Planning and construction === During the early 1970s, the poor local transport system was identified as one of the main factors holding back the region's economy, and in 1971 a study was commissioned by the recently created Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority (now known as Nexus) into how the transport system could be improved. This study recommended reviving the badly run-down former Tyneside Electrics network by converting it into an electrified rapid transit

Tripadvisor gives a Travelers' Choice award to accommodations, attractions and restaurants that consistently earn great reviews from travelers and are ranked within the top 10% of properties on Tripadvisor. Having a day to spare we thought that visiting Whitley Bay from Newcastle, where we were staying, would be a good trip down memory lane. A bit of research made the Metro the obvious choice and the PS5.90 all-day everywhere pass looked the simplest option. Easy to buy the ticket and the trains were frequent and clean, albeit about to be replaced by new units. The bonus is that you can sit up-front next to the driver's cab and get a great view of the journey ahead. After getting off at Cullercoats and walking to Whitley Bay we then did the whole loop to South Shields and then back to Central Station - a great day out.

The Tyne & Wear Metro System covers quite a bit of the city. There are two lines, one from Newcastle Airport to South Hylton via Newcastle city centre, Gateshead and Sunderland. The other line runs from Newcastle to South Shields via Byker, Whitley Bay and back through the city. Trains run about every 12 minutes on each route so you should not have to wait too long for a train. The trains I travelled on were all clean and there are seats and areas to stand. The staff I met were friendly and helpful. Written December 6, 2021 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Newcastle upon Tyne, or simply Newcastle ( new-KASS-əl, RP: NEW-kah-səl), is a cathedral city and metropolitan borough in Tyne and Wear, England. It is England's northernmost metropolitan borough, located on the River Tyne's northern bank opposite Gateshead to the south. It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England. Newcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as Monkchester before taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. It was one of the world's largest ship building and repair centres during the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, but governed as a county corporate after 1400. In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear. The local authority is Newcastle City Council, which is a constituent member of the North East Mayoral Combined Authority. == History == === Roman === The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius (""Hadrian's bridge""), a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius then is estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian's Wall are visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the ""Roman Wall"" can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend – the ""wall's end"" – and to the separate supply fort of Arbeia in South Shields, across the river from Hadrian's Wall. The extent of Hadrian's Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a major invasion. However, it seems that the Vallum stopped just west of Newcastle, where its role as a secondary line of defence was performed by the River Tyne. === Anglo-Saxon and Norman === After the Roman departure from Britain, completed in 410, Newcastle became part of the powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, and was known throughout this period as Munucceaster (sometimes modernised as Monkchester). Conflicts with the Danes in 876 left the settlements along the River Tyne in ruins. After the conflicts with the Danes, and following the 1088 rebellion against the Normans, Monkchester was all but destroyed by Odo of Bayeux. Because of its strategic position, Robert Curthose, son of William the Conqueror, erected a wooden castle there in the year 1080. The town was henceforth known as Novum Castellum or New Castle. The wooden structure was replaced by a stone castle in 1087. The castle was rebuilt again in 1172 during the reign of Henry II. Much of the keep which can be seen in the city today dates from this period. === Middle Ages === Throughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress. In 1400 Newcastle was separated from Northumberland for administrative purposes and made a county of itself by Henry IV. Newcastle was given the title of the county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne. The town had a new charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1589. A 25-foot-high (7.6 m) stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century. === 16th to 19th centuries === From 1530, a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses",1,1,1,5

The UEFA Champions League is a seasonal football competition established in 1955. Prior to the 1992–93 season, the tournament was named the European Cup. The UEFA Champions League is open to the league champions of all UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) member associations (except Liechtenstein, which has no league competition), as well as to the clubs finishing from second to fourth position in the strongest leagues. Originally, only the champions of their respective national league and the defending champions of the competition were allowed to participate. However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well, and again in 1999 when third and fourth-placed teams of the said leagues also became eligible. In the Champions League era, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition. Teams that have won the UEFA Champions League three consecutive times, or five times overall, receive a multiple-winner badge. Six teams have earned this privilege: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Liverpool, and Barcelona. Until 2009, clubs that had earned that badge were allowed to keep the European Champion Clubs' Cup and a new one was commissioned; since 2009, the winning team each year has received a full-size replica of the trophy, while the original is retained by UEFA. A total of 23 clubs have won the Champions League/European Cup. Real Madrid holds the record for the most victories, having won the competition 15 times, including the inaugural edition. They have also won the competition the most consecutive times, with five straight titles from 1956 to 1960. Juventus have been runners-up the most times, losing seven finals. Atlético Madrid is the only team to reach three finals without having won the trophy while Reims and Valencia have finished as runners-up twice without winning. Spain has provided the most champions, with twenty wins from two clubs. England have produced fifteen winners from a record six clubs and Italy have produced twelve winners from three clubs. English teams were banned from the competition for five years following the Heysel disaster in 1985. The current champions are Real Madrid, who beat Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final. While the venue for the final is chosen well in advance, on four occasions clubs have reached a final scheduled to be played in their own stadium; Real Madrid won their second European Cup in the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in 1957, while in 1965 Inter Milan also won their second title in the final at the San Siro. In 1984, the Stadio Olimpico in Rome was the venue and saw Roma defeated on penalties by Liverpool, while 2012 saw the Allianz Arena host the final between Bayern Munich and Chelsea, which the English club also won on penalties. == List of finals == The ""Season"" column refers to the season the competition was held, and wikilinks to the article about that season. The wikilinks in the ""Score"" column point to the article about that season's final game. == Performances == === By club === === By nation === Teams from thirteen nations have appeared in a Champions League final, and teams from ten of those have won the competition. Since the 1995–96 season, other than Porto's win in 2003–04, the winners have come from one of only four nations – Spain (13), England (7), Germany (4) and Italy (4) – and other than Monaco in 2003–04 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2019–20, the runners-up have all come from the same four nations.

80,what ocean is around hawaii?,Pacific Ocean,Pacific Ocean,"Hawaii ( hə-WY-ee; Hawaiian: Hawaiʻi [həˈvɐjʔi, həˈwɐjʔi]) is an island state of the United States, in the Pacific Ocean about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) southwest of the U.S. mainland. One of the two non-contiguous U.S. states (alongside Alaska), it is the only state not on the North American mainland, the only state that is an archipelago, and the only state in the tropics. Hawaii consists of 137 volcanic islands that comprise almost the entire Hawaiian archipelago (the exception, which is outside the state, is Midway Atoll). Spanning 1,500 miles (2,400 km), the state is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. Hawaii's ocean coastline is consequently the fourth-longest in the U.S., at about 750 miles (1,210 km). The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, are Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and Hawaiʻi, after which the state is named; the latter is often called the ""Big Island"" or ""Hawaii Island"" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands make up most of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, the largest protected area in the U.S. and the fourth-largest in the world. Of the 50 U.S. states, Hawaii is the fourth-smallest in land area and the 11th-least populous; but with 1.4 million residents, it ranks 13th in population density. Two-thirds of Hawaii residents live on O'ahu, home to the state's capital and largest city, Honolulu. Hawaii is among the country's most demographically diverse states, owing to its central location in the Pacific and over two centuries of migration. As one of only seven majority-minority states, it has the only Asian American plurality, the largest Buddhist community, and largest proportion of multiracial people in the U.S. Consequently, Hawaii is a unique melting pot of North American and East Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian heritage. Settled by Polynesians sometime between 1000 and 1200 CE, Hawaii was home to numerous independent chiefdoms. In 1778, British explorer James Cook was the first known non-Polynesian to arrive at the archipelago; early British influence is reflected in the state flag, which bears a Union Jack. An influx of European and American explorers, traders, and whalers soon arrived, leading to the decimation of the once-isolated indigenous community through the introduction of diseases such as syphilis, tuberculosis, smallpox, and measles; the native Hawaiian population declined from between 300,000 and one million to less than 40,000 by 1890. Hawaii became a unified, internationally recognized kingdom in 1810, remaining independent until American and European businessmen overthrew the monarchy in 1893; this led to annexation by the U.S. in 1898. As a strategically valuable U.S. territory, Hawaii was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941, which brought it global and historical significance, and contributed to America's entry into World War II. Hawaii is the most recent state to join the union, on August 21, 1959. In 1993, the U.S. government formally apologized for its role in the overthrow of Hawaii's government, which had spurred the Hawaiian sovereignty movement and has led to ongoing efforts to obtain redress for the indigenous population. Historically dominated by a plantation economy, Hawaii remains a major agricultural exporter due to its fertile soil and uniquely tropical climate in the U.S. Its economy has gradually diversified since the mid-20th century, with tourism and military defense becoming the two largest sectors. The state attracts visitors, surfers, and scientists with its diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundant public beaches, oceanic surroundings, active volcanoes, and clear skies on the Big Island. Hawaii hosts the United States Pacific Fleet, the world's largest naval command, as well as 75,000 employees of the Defense Department. Hawaii's isolation results in one of the highest cos

HAWAII NATURE NOTES THE PUBLICATION OF THE NATURALIST DIVISION, HAWAII NATIONAL PARK AND THE HAWAII NATURAL HISTORY ASSOCIATION VOL. IV MAY 1951 No. 2 GEOLOGIC SETTING Fifteen hundred miles across the central Pacific stretches the line of islands that we call the Hawaiian Archipelago (see Figure 1). From Ocean (Kure) Island at the northwest, we pass southeastward by Midway and Gardner Islands, French Frigates Shoal, Necker, Nihoa, and Kaula Islands, all of which are small low islands, until at Niihau we reach the first of the large islands of the Hawaiian group. There are eight of these major islands. In order southeastward they are: Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii. Most of the larger islands are well watered and clothed in tropical vegetationgreen jewels set in a hand of sparkling white surf, and laid in the blue plush of the ocean. The small islands northwest of Niihauthe so-called Leeward Islandsare too small to collect a toll of moisture from the passing winds. They are barren and waterless. Lanai and Kahoolawe also are dry, because the high islands to windward of them extract the water from the wind before it reaches them. FIGURE 1. Map of the Hawaiian Archipelago, showing the location of the major islands. The small inset map shows the position of the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean. (click on image for an enlargement in a new window) Tiny dots upon a map of the Pacific, the Hawaiian Islands are in reality the tops of a range of mighty mountains, perhaps the greatest mountain range on earth, built up from the sea floor by thousands upon thousands of volcanic eruptions. The average depth of the floor of the ocean on the two sides of the island chain is about 15,000 feet. Thus the lowest of the islands are mountains more than 15,000 feet high; and Mauna Kea, on the island of Hawaii, rises some 30,000 feet above its base. It is certainly the highest island peak in the world, and quite probably is the world's highest mountain in terms of elevation above the ocean floor. The Hawaiian mountains were born when a fissure opened in a northwest-southeast direction across the floor of the Pacific Ocean. How long ago this happened we have no way of knowing. We believe the oldest rocks of the major islands now visible above sea level may date from the late Tertiary period of geologic time, some 30 or 40 million years ago. Obviously the oldest rocks, at the base of the heap on the ocean floor, must be very much older, perhaps 60 million years old, or even more. Through most of the period of the islands' growth upward through the ocean water the building force of volcanism met little opposition. But as the top of the mountain reached into shallower water near the surface of the sea first currents and then waves began to attack the growing mass, knocking fragments of lava rock loose and washing them away into deeper water. When eventually the volcanoes thrust their heads above the sea their struggle for existence became still more intense. Then began the great battle between the constructive forces of volcanism, ever striving to build the island upward and outward with flow upon flow of new lava, and the destructive forces of wave, stream, wind, and even ice erosion, carving away the land and carting away the debris to dump it into the ever-hungry abysses of the ocean. So long as volcanism continued fully active the islands continued to grow, but when volcanic activity weakened and finally died out the powers of erosion seized control. Great canyons were carved into the slopes by streams, waves battered away at the shores, cutting them back into high cliffs with broad shallowly submerged platforms at their bases, and the whole land mass was gradually worn away. The ultimate end of this process is a broad, nearly flat platform cutting across the volcanic cone a few tens of fathoms below sea level. All that is left of the former islands is a shoal. Before this final stage of erosion is reached, however, a new agent of construction appears. On the shallowly submerged platforms, organisms such as corals start to grow in abundance, and secrete their limy skeletons to form reefs. In early stages these reefs surround a central volcanic island, and are known as fringing reefs. In later stages the volcanic island may disappear entirely leaving only a limestone reef, slightly submerged to form a shoal, or projecting slightly above the water to form an island. Such ""coral"" islands are ring-shaped and are known as atolls. Volcanism appears to have progressed southeastward along the great fissure in the ocean floor. At least, the volcanoes at the northwestern end of the Hawaiian chain ceased activity long before those at the southeastern end. The northwesternmost volcanic mountains have been eroded away until no more volcanic rock can be seen. The visible parts of Ocean and Midway Islands are formed entirely of organic limestone and calcareous sand, the remains of lime-secreting sea animals and plants. We feel quite certain, however, that at some comparatively small depth the limestone rests on the truncated summits of great volcanic mountains. At French Frigates Shoal, La Perouse Rock is a tiny remaining pinnacle of volcanic rock projecting through the limy reefs. Necker and Nihoa Islands are remains of once much larger volcanic islands, and Niihau has lost a great slice of its eastern slope through marine erosion. Kauai and Oahu Islands were deeply eroded by streams and waves before a renewal of volcanic activity buried much of their lowlands beneath floods of late lavas. On Maui, the volcanic mountain comprising the western part of the island has been deeply dissected by streams, with the formation of huge valleys such as Iao. Haleakala Volcano, forming the eastern part of Maui, also had great valleys cut into it by stream erosion before renewed volcanism partly buried the work of the streams. Hawaii is the southernmost and largest of the islands and also the youngest. Of the five great volcanoes (Figure 2) that built this largest of deep-sea islands, Kohala Volcano at the northern end of the island is the oldest. Streams have cut huge spectacular canyons into its rainy northeastern slope, and waves driven by the nearly constant trade winds have cut high cliffs along its northeastern shore. Next to the south, Mauna Kea has not been active since the arrival of the Hawaiian people, but has erupted since its summit was covered by a small glacier during the last great period of glaciation, perhaps within the last 15,000 years. Hualalai, on the western part of the island, has erupted once in historic time, in 1801. The two southernmost volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kilauea, are still in their full vigor of activity and for the most part are almost unmarred by erosion. FIGURE 2. Map of the island of Hawaii, showing the location of the principal volcanic mountains and the historic lava flows. (click on image for an enlargement in a new window)

What ocean are the Hawaiian islands located in? Question: Hawaiian Culture: Hawaii is known for its unique culture of foods and events called luaus. You can probably picture a person sitting on the beach, by a fire, playing a ukulele (small guitar-like instrument). People are dancing, singing, and eating foods like poi, which is a common dish made from a taro root (similar to what we call potatoes). They also commonly wear things called leis (pronounced lays) around their necks and girls may wear grass skirts. Hawaii is a beautiful place where you can find beaches, mountains, and volcanoes!",5,5,5,1
81,when did kelly slater go pro?,Kelly Slater went pro in 1990 when he won his first professional event at the Quiksilver Pro Teahupoo event.,2008 ASP World Tour,"Kelly Slater Kelly Slater Supernaturally talented pro surfer from Cocoa Beach, Florida; a record-breaking eleven-time world champion (1992, 1994-98, 2005-2006, 2008, 2010-2011 ) who reinvented virtually every aspect of high-performance surfing. ""His competitive statistics numb the brain,"" world champion Shaun Tomson said of Slater, ""and yet his most significant contributions have come from outside the competitive arena. No sportsman in the world anywhere has for so many years been so far ahead of his peers."" Slater was born (1972) and raised in Cocoa Beach, the son of a bait-and-tackle shop owner father, and began surfing at age five. By 11 he was an unstoppable amateur competitor, and in 1984 he won the first of four consecutive United States Surfing Championships titles, two in the menehune division and two in the boys' division. At 14, mentored by aerialist pioneer and surfboard manufacturer Matt Kechele, Slater won not only the boys' division of the Eastern Surfing Festival at Florida's Canaveral Pier, but the pro division as well--turning down the money to keep his amateur status. Turning pro at 18, Slater won the $100,000 Body Glove Surf Bout contest at Trestles in 1990, and signed a six-figure contract with beachwear giant Quiksilver. ""Believe the hype,"" surf journalist Ben Marcus wrote. ""He is a certified phenomenon."" Slatermania, as it was soon being called, was helped by the fact that the brown-haired, green-eyed Floridian was incredibly handsome. Surfer magazine compared him to a young Elvis Presley. Surf journalist Derek Rielly, playing on the newcomer's deification--but as astounded by his talent as anyone--wrote that seeing Slater surf for the first time was ""like being led by the infant Jesus to the promised land."" People magazine included Slater in its 1991 ""50 Most Beautiful People"" issue. Slater's range and repertoire would expand in the years ahead, but at age 18 the basics were already in place. His stance and balance were similar to those of three-time world champion Tom Curren of California. Slater would never match Curren for fluidity, but his legs had more spring, his body was more limber, his approach was more innovative, and he had matchless coordination and reflexes. Wiry but strong (5'9'', 160 pounds), Slater could adjust his line from virtually anywhere on the wave; he was faster than any of his peers going into maneuvers, and the angle of his turns was more acute. Frequently powering his moves just past the edge of control--often in the form of a drifting tailslide--Slater trusted that he could find his way back to center before falling off. He also brought aerial surfing in from the sport's fringes, not just because his success rate was higher than anybody else's, but because he smoothly mixed aerials into the ride along with deep-set turns and cutbacks. Slater ran hot and cold during his rookie world tour year in 1991, finished the season ranked 43rd, and was regarded as a longshot contender for the 1992 championship. But he moved into the ratings lead halfway through the 1992 season, pulled away from his rivals, won the title with room to spare in the second-to-last event, then punctuated with the season-ending victory in the Pipeline Masters. At 20, he was pro surfing's youngest-ever world champion. Meanwhile, his moves were being studied and dissected by tens of thousands of young surfers around the world, as he starred in Momentum (1992), Taylor Steele's debut video, as well as Kelly Slater in Black and White (1992), the first sponsor-funded video biography. Just weeks after winning the championship, Slater announced that he had taken a supporting role on Baywatch, the banal but hugely successful lifeguard drama TV show starring the buxom Pamela Anderson. Slater left the show a little over a year later, having appeared in 10 episodes as Malibu High School surfer Jimmy Slade; he would be romantically linked to Anderson for the next seven years. After dropping to sixth in the year-end ratings for 1993, Slater came back the following year to win the first of five consecutive championships. In the mid-'90s, Slater's surfing was in part defined by his protean tuberiding skill; he created the butt-drag stall and the double-arm stall, perfected the no-hands backside tube stance, and even pivoted around now and then to ride the barrel as a goofyfooter. It was sublime tuberiding that won him another four Pipeline Masters titles before the decade ended (1994, 1995, 1996, and 1999), as well as the 1995 Quiksilver Pro at Grajagan and the 1995 Billabong Challenge at Jeffreys Bay. Quiksilver fittingly raised his annual salary to a rumored $1 million a year. The even-tempered and surprisingly unaffected Slater continued to have a strong presence in the nonsurfing world: he was profiled by the Los Angeles Times Magazine in 1995, made the cover of Interview in 1996, and was profiled by Outside in 1999. Slater briefly retired from full-time competition at the end of the 1998 season, having just won his sixth world championship, along with the 1995 and 1998 Triple Crown titles. Along with world tour friend Rob Machado and La Jolla surfer Peter King, Slater formed a band called the Surfers, with Slater playing guitar and singing lead. Their 1998 release Songs from the Pipe, produced by Grammy winner T-Bone Burnett, was released to indifferent reviews and low sales. Slater also revealed in 1998 that two years earlier he'd fathered a child out of wedlock. Over the next three years Slater entered a few world tour contests, winning the Pipeline Masters in 1999 and the Gotcha Pro at Teahupoo in 2000. He also competed in big-wave events, finishing runner-up in the 2000 Men Who Ride Mountains event at Maverick's and winning the Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau at Waimea Bay in early 2002. Slater's much-anticipated return to full-time world tour competition in 2002, however, was something of a disappointment initially, as he finished the season rated #9. But the arrival that year of Kauai's Andy Irons reignited Slater's competitive fire. Irons would be the only worthy rival in Slater's career. Slater finished 2nd to Irons in 2003, lost to him again in 2004, then finally claimed his seventh world title--just ahead of Irons--in 2005. Then, for good measure, beat Irons again for the 2006 tour championship. The titles continued to pile up--his 11th title in 2011 came at age 39--and he added a sixth Pipeline Masters trophy in 2008. Every possible pro surfing record, including most wins and most prize money, were now his. In 2012 Slater narrowly missed adding a 12th world title, losing a nail biter in the last event of the year to Joel Parkinson of Australia. 2013 was a repeat, with Mick Fanning this time winning the title, again at the last contest of the season--the Pipeline Masters--relegating Slater to runner-up, though Slater ultimately won the event, his seventh Pipe Masters win. Slater's sustained greatness brought further attention from the non-surfing world. Former ESPN anchor and Sports Illustrated writer Dan Patrick devoted an episode of his popular sports talk radio show in 2010 to debating whether or not Slater was the greatest athlete in history (Patrick's answer: no, but he was close). In 2010 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan resolution honoring Slater's competitive achievements. GQ magazine put him on the cover of a 2011 issue dedicated to the ""25 Coolest Athletes of All Time,"" a list that included Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, and Arnold Palmer; he also posed nude for ESPN the Magazine's 2010 ""Body Issue."" The National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian added one of Slater's boards to their public exhibition space in 2011. A refreshingly articulate Slater even made a 2009 guest appearance on NPR's popular radio show Wait, Wait...Don't Tell Me! On November 17 2010, the city of Cocoa Beach unveiled a 10-foot tall bronze statue of Slater on a popular waterfront promenade; the mayor officially declared the date ""Kelly Slater Day."" Slater won a record eight consecutive Surfer Magazine Readers Poll Awards from 1993 to 2001; he then repeated the feat from 2004-2012. In 2009 Surfer ranked Slater #1 in their ""50 Greatest Surfers of All Time"" list, just ahead of Duke Kahanamoku (#2) and Tom Curren (#3). In 2000, Slater became the first pro surfer to have his own website. The year 2002 brought his induction into the Huntington Beach Surfing Walk of Fame and the release of Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer video game, patterned on the best-selling Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Slater's first autobiography, Pipe Dreams, was published in 2003; a second book, Kelly Slater: For the Love, co-written with Phil Jarratt, came out in 2008, the same year that he launched the Kelly Slater Wave Company, with the goal of producing world-class artificial waves. In a surprising move that he announced to the world via social media on April Fools Day, 2014, Slater left Quiksilver, his sponsor of 23 years. As of 2013, Slater was unmarried, and living in Santa Barbara, California. In 2011, the website CelebrityNetWorth.com estimated that Slater was worth $22 million.

Kelly SlaterAmerican surfer Kelly Slater after winning a heat at the Hurley Pro at Trestles competition in San Clemente, California, on September 10, 2016. Slater is considered the greatest surfer of all time. Kelly Slater (born February 11, 1972, Cocoa Beach, Florida, U.S.) is widely considered the greatest surfer of all time. He earned the title of world champion an unprecedented 11 times, including a record five times consecutively (1994-98), and he was also the all-time leader in event wins. Kelly SlaterAmerican surfer Kelly Slater riding the barrel of a wave during a competition in Teahupoo, Tahiti, French Polynesia, on May 10, 2000. The son of a bait-store proprietor, Slater grew up near the water, and he began surfing at age five. By age 10 he was winning age-division events up and down the Atlantic coast, and in 1984 he won his first age-division United States championship title. Two years later he finished third in the junior division at the world amateur championships in England, and he won the Pacific Cup junior championship in Australia the following year. After turning professional in 1990, Slater struggled during his first two years on the professional tour, finishing 90th and 43rd in the world rankings those years. In 1992 he secured podium (top-three) finishes in three of his first five events before winning his first professional tour event, the Rip Curl Pro, in France. His win in that year's prestigious Pipeline Masters in Hawaii secured his first world title, and at age 20 he became the youngest surfing world champion at the time. Slater finished sixth in the 1993 rankings but came back in 1994 to begin a five-year run of complete domination of the world tour, earning the champion's crown every year between 1994 and 1998. He then took a break from competitive surfing at the end of 1998. Kelly SlaterKelly Slater taking to the skies in the Quiksilver Pro at Hossegor, France, on October 5, 2002. Successful aerials earn the biggest scores in surfing competitions. During his years off the world tour, Slater appeared in assorted surf films, television shows, and video games. He returned to the world pro tour in 2002, finished a close second in the world rankings in 2003, and won his first posthiatus championship in 2005. He won his 11th world title in 2011, thereby becoming both the youngest and the oldest male surfer to have won the championship. That same year, 18-year-old Carissa Moore broke his record for being the youngest surfing world champion across the women's and men's circuits. Slater's autobiography, Pipe Dreams: A Surfer's Journey (cowritten with Jason Borte), was published in 2003, and his second book, Kelly Slater: For the Love (cowritten with Phil Jarratt), appeared in 2008.

52 things you probably didn't know about Kelly Slater Kelly Slater is the most successful pro surfer of all time. With 11 world surfing titles under his belt, the Floridian is also one of the most popular athletes on the planet. Today, Slater is more than just a surfer. He is surfing's greatest athlete of all time (GOAT), but also an activist for environmental causes, a philanthropist, and a successful entrepreneur. Kelly Slater's artificial wave pool system helped change the future of the sport, but when it comes to competing and winning titles, he's not done yet. The Floridian says he will surf Pipeline until he's 90; he inherited this competitiveness from his mother. The Kelly Slater world is rich, deep, vibrant, and colorful. As an athlete, he's the past, present, and future of surfing. As a man, he is a savvy gentleman with a wide variety of tastes and preferences. Sometimes, he even gets political and controversial.

82,what sarah dessen books are movies?,"I don't know. Sarah Dessen is an author known for her young adult novels, but I do not have information on which of her books have been adapted into movies.",The Truth About Forever,"Horton Hears a Who! (also known as Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who! or simply Horton) is a 2008 American animated adventure comedy film based on the 1954 book of the same name by Dr. Seuss, produced by Blue Sky Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The film was directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino, from a screenplay written by the writing team of Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. It stars the voices of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell as Horton the Elephant and Mayor Ned McDodd, respectively, alongside Carol Burnett, Will Arnett, Seth Rogen, Dan Fogler, Isla Fisher, Jonah Hill, and Amy Poehler. Recurring Blue Sky collaborator John Powell composed the film's musical score. It is the fourth screen adaptation of the book following the 1970 Chuck Jones television special, the 1987 Soviet animated short, and the 1992 Russian animated short. The film was released theatrically on March 14, 2008, to generally positive reviews, and grossed $298 million on a budget of $85 million. Horton Hears a Who! was the third Dr. Seuss feature film adaptation, the first adaptation to be fully animated using CGI technology, the first and so far only theatrical film adaptation to receive positive reviews, and the second Dr. Seuss film starring Jim Carrey after How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). == Plot == In the Jungle of Nool, Horton the Elephant, the jungle's eccentric nature teacher, hears a tiny yelp coming from a floating dust speck and gives chase to it before placing it on top of a flower. Horton finds out the speck harbors the city of Whoville and its inhabitants, the Whos, led by Mayor Ned McDodd, whose family includes his wife, Sally; 96 daughters whose names all begin with the letter H; and one teenage son named JoJo. Despite being the oldest child and next in line for the mayoral position, JoJo does not want to be the next mayor, and he does not speak due to his fear of disappointing his father. Once Horton begins carrying the speck with him, the city starts experiencing strange phenomena (earthquakes and changes in the weather), and the mayor finds his attempts to caution Whoville challenged by the town council, led by the opportunistic yet condescending chairman. After he makes contact with Horton, the mayor finds out from Dr. Mary Lou LaRue that Whoville will be destroyed if Horton does not find a safe location for the speck to reside. With the help of his best friend Morton the mouse, Horton decides to place the speck atop Mt. Nool, the safest place in the jungle. The head of the jungle, the Sour Kangaroo, who despises Horton for his lackadaisical influence on the children and subsequently ""pouch-schooling"" her son Rudy, demands numerous times that Horton give up the speck for overshadowing her authority, but Horton refuses. Also taking force toward Horton are the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys and lackeys to the Kangaroo who like to cause havoc around the jungle. Eventually, the Kangaroo, refusing to believe that the Whos exist, enlists a sinister but idiotic vulture named Vlad Vladikoff to get rid of the speck by force. After a few failed attempts, Vlad manages to steal the flower away from Horton and drops it into a massive field of identical pink flowers causing an apocalyptic tremor in Whoville. After unsuccessfully picking flowers all day, Horton eventually recovers the flower (exactly the 3,000,000th flower), also revealing himself to the rest of Whoville, who have largely survived. The Kangaroo eventually finds out that Horton still has the speck, fires Vlad, and rallies the jungle community into arresting Horton, preying on their fears that their own children will become chaotic delinquents under his influence. Upon cornering him, the Kangaroo offers Horton a final chance to renounce Whoville's existence. Horton refuses, and despite the heartfelt speech that he gives, the Kangaroo orders the animals to rope and cage him, and to have the speck and Whoville destroyed in a pot of beezlenut oil. The Mayor enlists a

On the one hand, and on behalf of the British, and the Germans. In the following days. By",Battle of Dunkirk,"Why was the Dunkirk evacuation necessary? Nazi Germany invaded northern France and the Low Countries in May 1940 during the early years of World War II. The German strategy, called blitzkrieg, relied on sustained and concentrated forward momentum to ensure a swift victory before the enemy could respond. Gen. Paul Ludwig von Kleist surprised the Allies by advancing through Luxembourg and into France over the course of five days. France did not have the strength to mount an immediate counteroffensive. The French government panicked and nearly evacuated Paris; their worries were compounded by further German advances into Belgium on May 17. The Germans cut off various Allied escape ports along the English Channel and quickly shrunk their defensive lines. With Belgium's surrender on May 28, an evacuation of French and British troops from the European mainland became imperative. How was the Dunkirk evacuation executed? Even before the German military forced Belgium's surrender on May 28, 1940, the British government had been quietly preparing for an evacuation of its ground forces and other Allied troops under the code name Operation Dynamo. Adm. Bertram Home Ramsay directed this operation and charged Capt. William Tennant with its tactical oversight. They determined that the beach at the French seaport of Dunkirk would best serve this purpose. However, Dunkirk's beach was too shallow for Royal Navy battleships to safely approach, so the British admiralty assembled approximately 700 civilian craft that would transport troops to battleships waiting in the North Sea. Tennant observed that evacuating troops directly from the beach would be an arduous and potentially costly process. To remedy this, he directed the soldiers to board rescue ships from a 1,400-yard (1.3-km)-long breakwater to the east. From May 26 to June 4, over 338,000 British and French troops were safely evacuated from Dunkirk. Critical to this process was the British Royal Air Force, which intercepted German bombers above the beach. Together with the civilians who aided the Royal Navy, they saved countless lives. What was the significance of the Dunkirk evacuation? Dunkirk was a critical turning point in World War II. German dictator Adolf Hitler's blitzkrieg strategy depended on maintaining concentrated forward momentum in its invasion of France and Belgium; Germany had overrun the region by May 1940. However, Hitler exercised restraint at Dunkirk, halting his panzer tanks short of the seaport only days before the evacuation. By the time he resumed attacks, the evacuation had begun. Several factors were at play, one potentially being Hitler's belief that the British would more readily negotiate if he exhibited clemency. The opposite was the case. The British transformed the Dunkirk evacuation into a moment of national pride and perseverance. On June 4 Prime Minister Winston Churchill roused his country by declaring: ""[We] shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."" The immediate context of the Dunkirk evacuation was Germany's invasion of the Low Countries and northern France in May 1940. On May 10 the German blitzkrieg attack on the Netherlands began with the capture by parachutists of key bridges deep within the country, with the aim of opening the way for mobile ground forces. The Dutch defenders fell back westward, and by noon on May 12 German tanks were on the outskirts of Rotterdam. Queen Wilhelmina and her government left the country for England on May 13, and the next day the Dutch army surrendered to the Germans. How the halt command saved British troops in DunkirkOverview of the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, 1940. The invasion of Belgium also began on May 10, when German airborne troops landed on the fortress of Eben Emael, immediately opposite Maastricht, and on bridges over the Albert Canal. On May 11 the Belgian front was broken, and German tanks ran on westward while Belgian, French, and British divisions fell back to a line between Antwerp and Namur. World War IIGerman troops and French prisoners of war crossing the Meuse River after the Battle of Sedan, May 15, 1940. The German invasion of France hinged on Gen. Paul Ludwig von Kleist's surprise advance through the hilly and dense Ardennes Forest. On May 10 German tanks crossed Luxembourg to the southeastern border of Belgium, and by the evening of May 12 the Germans were across the Franco-Belgian frontier and overlooking the Meuse River. The next day they crossed the Meuse, and on May 15 they broke through the French defenses into open country, turning westward in the direction of the English Channel. That same day, Gen. Henri Giraud assumed command of the French Ninth Army and drew up a plan for a counteroffensive on a line 25 miles (40 km) west of the Meuse. On May 16 Giraud found that the forces for such an undertaking were not available, while the Germans had advanced in strength far beyond that line. He now decided to withdraw to the line of the Oise, 30 miles (48 km) farther back, and to block the Germans there. Once again he was too late, for the German panzer divisions outran his retreating troops and were across that barrier on May 17. Even if the French had been able to mount a counteroffensive, they would not have found it easy to crush the invader. Kleist's southern flank was progressively lined by his motorized divisions, which in turn were relieved by the infantrycorps that were marching on as fast as possible. This lining of the Aisne had an important indirect effect of playing on the most instinctive fear of the French. When, on May 15, French commander-in-chief Maurice Gamelin received an alarming report that the Germans were crossing the Aisne between Rethel and Laon, he told the government that he had no reserves between that sector and Paris and could not guarantee the security of the capital for more than a day. After Gamelin's startling message, French Premier Paul Reynaud hastily decided to move the seat of government from Paris to Tours. By evening more reassuring reports had come from the Aisne, and Reynaud broadcast a denial of ""the most absurd rumours that the government is preparing to leave Paris."" At the same time, he seized the opportunity to replace Gamelin and for that purpose summoned Gen. Maxime Weygand from Syria. Weygand did not arrive until May 19, and thus for three critical days the Supreme Command was without direction. While Allied leaders were still hoping for an attack that would cut off the expanding ""bulge,"" German armoured forces raced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium. The remaining obstacles that could have blocked the advance were not manned in time. After crossing the Oise on May 17, German Gen. Heinz Guderian's advance troops reached Amiens two days later. On May 20 they swept on and reached Abbeville, thus blocking all communications between north and south. By the next day motorized divisions had taken over the line of the Somme from Peronne to Abbeville, forming a strong defensive flank. Guderian's corps then turned north up the coast in a drive for Calais and Dunkirk on May 22. Gen. Georg-Hans Reinhardt swung south of the British rear position at Arras, headed for the same objective--the last escape port that remained open for the British. Allied planners had hoped to check the Germans at the Dyle Line--a defensive line that ran from Antwerp south to the French frontier, north of Sedan--but by May 16 Gamelin had determined that such a stand was impracticable. The Allied armies in Belgium wheeled back to the line of the Scheldt. By the time they arrived there, the position had been undermined by the cutting of their communications. On May 19 Gen. John Gort, commander in chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), began to consider the necessity of evacuating his forces by sea and the preparatory steps that such an endeavour would require. The next day, however, orders came from the British Cabinet that the BEF was to march south on Amiens. Gort argued that such a long-range drive in reverse was not practicable, either tactically or administratively. All he could manage was an attack by two divisions, which had just been rushed south to Arras, led by a brigade of infantry tanks, the only armoured troops he had. When this riposte was launched on May 21, it comprised no more than two tank battalions backed by two infantry battalions, while elements of one French light mechanized division covered its flanks. The British light tanks proved to be surprisingly effective against German antitank weapons, and this small drive into the corridor momentarily shook the nerve of the German High Command. German planners realized that if two or three armoured divisions had been available for a concentrated counterstroke, the German advance might have been dislocated. After this flash in the pan the Allied armies in the north made no further effort to break out of the trap, while the belated relieving push from the south was so feeble as to be almost farcical. The prevailing confusion was increased by Weygand's arrival to take over supreme command. The 73-year-old veteran of World War I was better at expounding outdated theory than grasping the realities of a rapidly changing, increasingly motorized battlefield. His grandiloquent orders had no more chance of being translated into practical terms than those of Reynaud or new British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. While the governments and commanders got into a tangle of divergent views and orders, the cut-off armies in the north fell back on a slant closer to the coast under increasing pressure from Gen. Walther von Reichenau's advance through Belgium. More dangerous still was the backdoor approach of Guderian, whose armoured forces were sweeping north past Boulogne and Calais. Dunkirk evacuationAn official checking the papers of French refugees during the Dunkirk evacuation, May-June 1940. Consequently, three of Gort's divisions were withdrawn from the front and sent south to strengthen the line of canals that covered Dunkirk and the Allies' rear. Two more divisions were allotted for Weygand's renewed project of a Franco-British drive down into the German corridor. When the Belgians' extended right flank, adjoining the British, gave way under pressure from Reichenau, these two divisions were rushed north again. By the time they arrived on May 27, the Belgian centre had cracked, and there were no reserves to fill this fresh gap. With their country overrun and their backs to the sea, in a small strip crowded with refugees, the Belgians were driven to sue for an armistice that evening. The cease-fire was sounded early the next morning.

Sir Christopher Edward Nolan (born 30 July 1970) is a British and American filmmaker. Known for his Hollywood blockbusters with complex storytelling, he is considered a leading filmmaker of the 21st century. Nolan's films have earned over $6.6 billion worldwide, making him the seventh-highest-grossing film director of all time. His accolades include two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and two British Academy Film Awards. Nolan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2019, and received a knighthood in 2024 for his contributions to film. Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), and transitioned into studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002). He became a high-profile director with The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012), and found further success with The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017). After the release of Tenet (2020), Nolan parted ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Pictures, and signed with Universal Pictures for the biographical thriller Oppenheimer (2023), which won him Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. Nolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. They feature mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas. == Early life == Christopher Edward Nolan was born on 30 July 1970, in Westminster, London. His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a British advertising executive of Irish descent who worked as a creative director. His mother, Christina Jensen, was an American flight attendant from Evanston, Illinois; she would later work as a teacher of English. He has an elder brother, Matthew, and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker. The three brothers were raised Catholic in Highgate and would spend their summers in Evanston. Nolan also spent time living in Chicago during his youth, and he holds both UK and US citizenship. Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Sir Ridley Scott and the science fiction films 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977). He would repeatedly watch the latter film and extensively research its making. Nolan began making films at the age of seven, borrowing his father's Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures. These films included a stop motion animation homage to Star Wars called Space Wars. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from ""clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls"". His uncle, who had worked at NASA building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: ""I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice"", Nolan later remarked. From the age of 11, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker. Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school in Witley, Surrey. In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. Nolan and Roko co-directed the surreal 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union, an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service. After a fan posted a copy of Tarantella online, in 2021, Nolan's production company filed a copyright infringement claim, to have the film removed.

Secondary navigation What you Need to Know about the Dunkirk Evacuations Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk, involved the rescue of more than 338,000 British and French soldiers from the French port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940. The evacuation, sometimes referred to as the Miracle of Dunkirk, was a big boost for British morale. Prime Minister Winston Churchill recognised however that the greatest challenge still lay ahead, as Nazi ambitions now turned toward Britain. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France and the Low Countries, pushing the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), along with French and Belgian troops, back to the French port of Dunkirk. A huge rescue, Operation 'Dynamo', was organised by the Royal Navy to get the troops off the beaches and back to Britain. Admiral Bertram Ramsay directed the evacuation. Ramsay had retired before the war but was recalled in 1939. He and his staff worked in a room deep in the Dover cliffs that had once contained a dynamo, a type of electrical generator, giving the operation its name. 'Dynamo' began on 26 May. Strong defences were established around Dunkirk, and the Royal Air Force sent all available aircraft to protect the evacuation. Over 800 naval vessels of all shapes and sizes helped to transport troops across the English Channel. The last British troops were evacuated on 3 June, with French forces covering their escape. The gently shelving beaches meant that large warships could only pick up soldiers from the town's East Mole, a sea wall which extended into deep water, or send their boats on the beaches to collect them. To speed up the process, the British Admiralty appealed to the owners of small boats for help. These became known as the 'little ships'. Churchill and his advisers had expected that it would be possible to rescue only 20,000 to 30,000 men, but in all 338,000 troops were rescued from Dunkirk, a third of them French. Ninety thousand remained to be taken prisoner and the BEF left behind the bulk of its tanks and heavy guns. All resistance in Dunkirk ended at 9.30am on 4 June. The Dunkirk evacuation was an important event for the Allies. If the BEF had been captured, it would have meant the loss of Britain's only trained troops and the collapse of the Allied cause. The successful evacuation was a great boost to civilian morale, and created the 'Dunkirk spirit' which helped Britain to fight on in the summer of 1940. Operation Dynamo explained Operation Dynamo is often described as a miracle. Over 338,000 allied soldiers were rescued from Dunkirk in the face of overwhelming odds. Discover what made the evacuations from Dunkirk so successful, how the British evacuation was carried out and why Winston Churchill regarded the operation as a 'miracle of deliverance'. The British evacuation from Dunkirk is often described as a miracle. Over 300,000 Allied soldiers pulled from the sea in the face of overwhelming odds and the so-called 'Dunkirk spirit' that made it happen helping Britain through its darkest hour. But what made the evacuations from Dunkirk so successful? and are the myths surrounding the operation to be believed? Well before we answer those questions and more a reminder to subscribe to the Imperial War Museums YouTube channel for more videos just like this every two weeks. The Dunkirk evacuation is looked upon as a miracle, a miracle of deliverance I think Churchill himself called it in the House of Commons. But it's not so much a miracle as a coming together of series of circumstances which played into the hands of Britain. And to be fair to the Allies they hadn't had much luck so far. Two weeks previously Germany began its invasion of the Low Countries with French and British forces then moving into Belgium to meet them, however this attack was just a diversion. Using cutting-edge blitzkrieg tactics German tanks smashed through the Allied weak point in the Ardennes and dashed to the coast surrounding the allies. If you want to find out what made this blitzkrieg attack so powerful we've got a video all about that linked in the description below. In Belgium and part of Northern France, we have virtually the whole of the British expeditionary force and a French army surrounded with their backs to the coast. So the British army started thinking about evacuation before anybody else did because they thought they might be able to save some of their army from what looked like a terrible disaster. But time was against them, the German spearhead that had cut the Allies off then began taking channel ports despite desperate Allied attempts to hold on to them. By May 26th Dunkirk was the final port remaining. Worse still the port itself had been badly damaged, leading to dire predictions of what would actually be possible during the evacuation. Well, the initial thoughts of the British government and high command was that they were going to try to save what they could. There was no expectation of getting the whole British Expeditionary Force out they thought they might get act between 30 and 45,000 men. Despite those predictions though the evacuation, codenamed Operation Dynamo, eventually managed to save over 338,000 Allied soldiers. So how did they do it? Well according to Paul there are three things that made these evacuations so successful. First was the weather. Yeah, the weather could hardly have been more favourable. There were very unusually for that time of year very light winds for most days there was not a lot of surf on the beach. That allowed men to load into smaller boats right on the beaches before boarding for larger ships, an impossible task on windier days, and when there was wind, that played into the Allies hands as well. The wind was from the east which blew smoke from the burning port of Dunkirk across the beach offering a bit of cover from air attack and also there's some low cloud for most of the period of the evacuation. Low cloud over the beach also protected the troops from air attack so they won in every sense weather-wise. Next up was a bit of ingenuity from the naval officer in charge of the evacuation, Captain William Tennant, which goes against one of those classic Dunkirk narratives. One of the things we remember or think we remember about Dunkirk is the little boats who took men off the beaches. Certainly they were there, over 300 of them, but that was a minority of the men who escaped. Most of the evacuation took place across one of the harbour breakwaters at Dunkirk. This was a very narrow thing with a walkway on top of it. Most of the men, I think around 200,000 of the 338,000 men, came off through that route as opposed to the beaches. The harbour mole was so effective because it allowed troops to step right from the harbour onto destroyers or other large ships rather than going through the time-consuming process of taking smaller boats from the beach. The mole was never designed to be used this way, but it was a major factor in making the Dunkirk evacuations such a success. Finally, let's look at the infamous German halt order which gave the Allies valuable time to create a defensive perimeter around the port of Dunkirk. People in the higher German command basically could not believe their luck. They always were assuming that the French would manage to launch a counter-attack and cut off those tanks that were advancing with such speed. They kept trying to get tanks to slow down so the infantry could catch up and so this halt order on the 24th of May is sort of another iteration of that caution. Another key issue were further Allied garrisons at other important towns. British defenders at Calais held on against all the odds until May 26th while French forces in Lille managed to occupy 10 German divisions alone. The Germans realised that, even though they won this battle effectively, they had not defeated France. France still had a huge army and they were going to need all their tanks in order to achieve this after they dealt with whatever happened at Dunkirk. They also thought that the German air force could destroy the troops in the bridgehead or any ships trying to save them, this was why that order was issued. Bring all of this together and you can see why so many more troops were saved than expected. The weather providing valuable cover from air attack, the harbour mole allowing extra men to embark, and the German halt order giving the Allies valuable time to set up defences. But what was it actually like to be in the town of Dunkirk? The soldiers there had a variety of experience and the British Army behaved in a variety of different ways. There was some heroism, on the other hand, there were instances of disorder and instances of panic. Scenes on the beaches varied from boredom as soldiers waited for pickup, to bedlam as the Luftwaffe swirled overhead. According to one soldier writing in his diary on May 30th, the situation was desperate ""every man for himself getting loaded"". We have in our collection a small French railway map which was pinched from the wall of a cafe by a soldier Bill Osborne. He expected that he might get separated from his unit and have to find his own way to the coast things were that chaotic. He also wrote a letter on a scrap of paper to his wife anticipating that he would be killed and telling her to make a new life with somebody else if she could. And for the soldiers who did escape the stress was not over. They were expecting a frosty reception on their return to Britain. They thought that they would be vilified by the public. They thought that they'd arrived home with their tail between their legs and yet they found themselves treated largely as heroes uh because people were so relieved at having saved so many men and this, for obvious reasons of national morale, was the line pushed by the press and the BBC. It was extraordinary that they'd saved as many men as they had, well what it didn't point out was that we'd had to leave all our equipment behind and Britain was effectively open to invasion at that point had the germans had either the plans or the will or the ability to do it. And that's the reason that so many of these myths surrounding Dunkirk exist. British morale was at a low point and so the British press emphasized stories of heroism like those so-called little ships. Most of those craft were piloted by Royal Navy crews rather than civilians and yet these stories of plucky Brits winning against the odds are the stories which have stuck around, part of what's become known as the 'Dunkirk spirit'. The myth certainly was necessary at the time you know keep people's morale up. Although Churchill in the House of Commons was was fairly straight with the House of Commons and said you know this is a deliverance but ""wars are not won by evacuations"". Victory for Britain was a long way off, but the evacuation at Dunkirk was one of the few rays of light in the Allied cause. It was a great success coming at the end of a dismal failure, a success which kept the British army intact and British morale afloat, for now. The following month France surrendered to Germany. The battle of Britain was about to begin. Explore Our Collection You can find photos, film and objects related to the Dunkirk evacuations on Collections Online.

84,where was auschwitz concentration camp located?,Oświęcim,Poland,"Auschwitz, also known as Auschwitz-Birkenau, opened in 1940 and was the largest of the Nazi concentration and death camps. Located in southern Poland, Auschwitz initially served as a detention center for political prisoners. However, it evolved into a network of camps where Jewish people and other perceived enemies of the Nazi state were exterminated, often in gas chambers, or used as slave labor. Some prisoners were also subjected to barbaric medical experiments led by Josef Mengele (1911-79). During World War II (1939-45), more than 1 million people, by some accounts, lost their lives at Auschwitz. In January 1945, with the Soviet army approaching, Nazi officials ordered the camp abandoned and sent an estimated 60,000 prisoners on a forced march to other locations. When the Soviets entered Auschwitz, they found thousands of emaciated detainees and piles of corpses left behind. Auschwitz Auschwitz: Genesis of Death Camps After the start of World War II, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), the chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, implemented a policy that came to be known as the ""Final Solution."" Hitler was determined not just to isolate Jews in Germany and countries annexed by the Nazis, subjecting them to dehumanizing regulations and random acts of violence. Instead, he became convinced that his ""Jewish problem"" would be solved only with the elimination of every Jew in his domain, along with artists, educators, Romas, communists, homosexuals, the mentally and physically handicapped and others deemed unfit for survival in Nazi Germany. Did you know? In October 1944, a group of Auschwitz ""Sonderkommando,"" young Jewish males responsible for removing corpses from crematoriums and gas chambers, staged a revolt. They assaulted their guards, using tools and makeshift explosives, and demolished a crematorium. All were apprehended and killed. To complete this mission, Hitler ordered the construction of death camps. Unlike concentration camps, which had existed in Germany since 1933 and were detention centers for Jews, political prisoners and other perceived enemies of the Nazi state, death camps existed for the sole purpose of killing Jews and other ""undesirables,"" in what became known as the Holocaust. History Shorts: The Moment Behind International Holocaust Remembrance Day Auschwitz: The Largest of the Death Camps Auschwitz, the largest and arguably the most notorious of all the Nazi death camps, opened in the spring of 1940. Its first commandant was Rudolf Hoss (1900-47), who previously had helped run the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Oranienburg, Germany. Auschwitz was located on a former military base outside Oswiecim, a town in southern Poland situated near Krakow, one of the country's largest cities. During the camp's construction, nearby factories were appropriated and all those living in the area were forcibly ejected from their homes, which were bulldozed by the Nazis. Auschwitz originally was conceived as a concentration camp, to be used as a detention center for the many Polish citizens arrested after Germany annexed the country in 1939. These detainees included anti-Nazi activists, politicians, resistance members and luminaries from the cultural and scientific communities. Once Hitler's Final Solution became official Nazi policy, however, Auschwitz was deemed an ideal death camp locale. For one thing, it was situated near the center of all German-occupied countries on the European continent. For another, it was in close proximity to the string of rail lines used to transport detainees to the network of Nazi camps. However, not all those arriving at Auschwitz were immediately exterminated. Those deemed fit to work were employed as slave labor in the production of munitions, synthetic rubber and other products considered essential to Germany's efforts in World War II. Auschwitz and Its Subdivisions At its peak of operation, Auschwitz consisted of several divisions. The original camp, known as Auschwitz I, housed between 15,000 and 20,000 political prisoners. Those entering its main gate were greeted with an infamous and ironic inscription: ""Arbeit Macht Frei,"" or ""Work Makes You Free."" Auschwitz II, located in the village of Birkenau, or Brzezinka, was constructed in 1941 on the order of Heinrich Himmler (1900-45), commander of the ""Schutzstaffel"" (or Select Guard/Protection Squad, more commonly known as the SS), which operated all Nazi concentration camps and death camps. Birkenau, the biggest of the Auschwitz facilities, could hold some 90,000 prisoners. It also housed a group of bathhouses where countless people were gassed to death, and crematory ovens where bodies were burned. The majority of Auschwitz victims died at Birkenau. More than 40 smaller facilities, called subcamps, dotted the landscape and served as slave-labor camps. The largest of these subcamps, Monowitz, also known as Auschwitz III, began operating in 1942 and housed some 10,000 prisoners. Life and Death in Auschwitz By mid-1942, the majority of those being sent by the Nazis to Auschwitz were Jews. Upon arriving at the camp, detainees were examined by Nazi doctors. Those detainees considered unfit for work, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women and the infirm, were immediately ordered to take showers. However, the bathhouses to which they marched were disguised gas chambers. Once inside, the prisoners were exposed to Zyklon-B poison gas. Individuals marked as unfit for work were never officially registered as Auschwitz inmates. For this reason, it is impossible to calculate the number of lives lost in the camp. For those prisoners who initially escaped the gas chambers, an undetermined number died from overwork, disease, insufficient nutrition or the daily struggle for survival in brutal living conditions. Arbitrary executions, torture and retribution happened daily in front of the other prisoners. Some Auschwitz prisoners were subjected to inhumane medical experimentation. The chief perpetrator of this barbaric research was Josef Mengele (1911-79), a German physician who began working at Auschwitz in 1943. Mengele, who came to be known as the ""Angel of Death,"" performed a range of experiments on detainees. For example, in an effort to study eye color, he injected serum into the eyeballs of dozens of children, causing them excruciating pain. He also injected chloroform into the hearts of twins to determine if both siblings would die at the same time and in the same manner. Liberation of Auschwitz: 1945 As 1944 came to a close and the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allied forces seemed certain, the Auschwitz commandants began destroying evidence of the horror that had taken place there. Buildings were torn down, blown up or set on fire, and records were destroyed. In January 1945, as the Soviet army entered Krakow, the Germans ordered that Auschwitz be abandoned. Before the end of the month, in what came to be known as the Auschwitz death marches, an estimated 60,000 detainees, accompanied by Nazi guards, departed the camp and were forced to march to the Polish towns of Gliwice or Wodzislaw, some 30 miles away. Countless prisoners died during this process; those who made it to the sites were sent on trains to concentration camps in Germany. When the Soviet army entered Auschwitz on January 27, they found approximately 7,600 sick or emaciated detainees who had been left behind barbed wire. The liberators also discovered mounds of corpses, hundreds of thousands of pieces of clothing and pairs of shoes and seven tons of human hair that had been shaved from detainees before their liquidation. According to some estimates, between 1.1 million to 1.5 million people, the vast majority of them Jews, died at Auschwitz during its years of operation. An estimated 70,000 to 80,000 Poles perished at the camp, along with 19,000 to 20,000 Romas and smaller numbers of Soviet prisoners of war and other individuals.

Auschwitz concentration camp, also known as Oświęcim concentration camp, was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland (in a portion annexed into Germany in 1939) during World War II and the Holocaust. It consisted of Auschwitz I, the main camp (Stammlager) in Oświęcim; Auschwitz II-Birkenau, a concentration and extermination camp with gas chambers; Auschwitz III-Monowitz, a labour camp for the chemical conglomerate IG Farben; and dozens of subcamps. The camps became a major site of the Nazis' Final Solution to the Jewish question. After Germany initiated World War II by invading Poland in September 1939, the Schutzstaffel (SS) converted Auschwitz I, an army barracks, into a prisoner-of-war camp. The initial transport of political detainees to Auschwitz consisted almost solely of Poles (for whom the camp was initially established). For the first two years, the majority of inmates were Polish. In May 1940, German criminals brought to the camp as functionaries established the camp's reputation for sadism. Prisoners were beaten, tortured, and executed for the most trivial of reasons. The first gassings—of Soviet and Polish prisoners—took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941. Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month, and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers. Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz, 1.1 million were murdered. The number of victims includes 960,000 Jews (865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival), 74,000 non-Jewish Poles, 21,000 Romani, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and up to 15,000 others. Those not gassed were murdered via starvation, exhaustion, disease, individual executions, or beatings. Others were killed during medical experiments. At least 802 prisoners tried to escape, 144 successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units, consisting of prisoners who operated the gas chambers, launched an unsuccessful uprising. After the Holocaust ended, only 789 Schutzstaffel personnel (no more than 15 percent) ever stood trial. Several were executed, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss. The Allies' failure to act on early reports of mass murder by bombing the camp or its railways remains controversial. As the Soviet Red Army approached Auschwitz in January 1945, toward the end of the war, the SS sent most of the camp's population west on a death march to camps inside Germany and Austria. Soviet troops entered the camp on 27 January 1945, a day commemorated since 2005 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the decades after the war, survivors such as Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, Elie Wiesel, and Edith Eger wrote memoirs of their experiences, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland founded the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum on the site of Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979 it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Auschwitz is the site of the largest mass murder in a single location in history. == Background == The ideology of Nazism combined elements of ""racial hygiene"", eugenics, antisemitism, pan-Germanism, and territorial expansionism, Richard J. Evans writes. Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party became obsessed by the ""Jewish question"". Both during and immediately after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany in 1933, acts of violence against German Jews became ubiquitous, and legislation was passed excluding them from certain professions, including the civil service and the law. Harassment and economic pressure encouraged Jews to leave Germany; their businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden from advertising in newspapers, and deprived of government contracts. On 15 September 1935, the Reichstag passed the Nuremberg Laws. One, the Reich Citizenship Law, defined as citizens those of ""German or related blood who demonstrate by their behaviour that they are willing and suitable to serve the German",1,1,5,5
85,what rainforest is in south america?,Amazon,Amazon Basin,"School subscriptions can access more than 175 downloadable unit bundles in our store for free (a value of $1,500). Range The rainforests of South America -- The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world, once covering almost half the South American continent. It once stretched across Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Suriname. The Amazon rainforest is being cut down daily and has shrunk to a fraction of its original size. The rapid rate at which it is disappearing makes an accurate range impossible to record. Habitat Description The Amazon is a wild and busy place. The air clings like a cloud, hot and moist. The smell is thick with rotting leaves and strong, sweet flower scents. Birds screech from overhead. Hidden animals scurry beneath the foliage causing leaves to rustle, as they search among the trees for food. Insects buzz and hum, and ants march in armies. This is the rainforest. Animals Found in This Habitat In the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, a golden lion tamarin scoops insects and other small animals out of a bromeliad for its dinner. A three-toed sloth slowly munches green leaves. Its fur grows a green moss in the wet air. That helps to hide it from hungry meat eaters. It is a lucky thing, for just above the trees a giant harpy eagle soars and looks for an animal to catch with its sharp claws. The trees are filled with sound and color -- a noisy scarlet macaw , a toucan or a spider monkey. On the forest floor, the agouti feeds on an avocado dropped from above. When it's finished, the leftover seed may take root in the rotting leaves, if there is enough light. A tapir nibbles at leaves. Off in the bush a huntingjaguar, one of the biggest predators in the Amazon, sniff the air for the scent of prey. Any animals caught unaware on the forest floor can become a meal for the hungry cat. A butterfly searches for blossoms, and a red-eyed tree frog waits for insects. The rain forest feeds them all. Smaller animals are busy in the forest too. Hummingbirds hover at giant blossoms to feed on nectar. While they collect, they carry pollen to another blossom, fertilizing the flowers as they go. Wasps, bees and bats also pollinate flowers as they collect nectar and pollen. Ants are everywhere. Busily carrying leaves or scraps of food back to their homes, they make a marching line for miles. As small as they are, they can be a fierce forest insect. They can have a painful bite or sting. There are many butterflies in the Amazon rain forest. The brilliant blue morpho butterfly glistens in the soft light. Owl butterflies search for ripened fruit. Painted ladies, monarchs, and heliconid butterflies feed on flower nectar and flash their bright colors throughout the forest. Plants Found in This Habitat Plants, like everything else in the rainforest, grow to giant sizes. The kapok tree can grow 150 feet high and have a huge branching trunk at the bottom called, a buttress to balance it in the shallow rain forest soil. In these buttresses, animals like boa constrictors find a safe place to hide. The monkey nut tree grows large cannonball fruits. The milk tree, when cut, spills out white drinkable sap. Brazil nut, mahogany, rubber, palm and mimosa trees, as well as giant ferns, fill out the forest. Vines called lianas wrap around the tree trunks, leaving long hanging tails through the forest. Strangler figs take over trees by rooting in their very bark. Bromeliads, maidenhair ferns, and many colorful orchids root in the crotches of branches where leaves and soil collect.

The Incredible Rainforests of South America Not all rainforests are alike Rainforests are ecosystems that experience a large amount of annual rainfall. They support an incredible number of plants, animals, and other life forms. Although they occur in different parts of the planet, tropical rainforests are found on and around the equator where sunlight is consistent throughout the year. Nature and Culture International has projects and protected areas in rainforest ecosystems in many types of rainforest in South America. Our work occurs in the lowland Amazon rainforest, cloud forests in the Andes, and the Choco forest of coastal Colombia and northern Ecuador. Andean Cloud Forest: Highland rainforest The extraordinary cloud forests of the Andes are a type of mid-altitude tropical rainforest. When humid air, transpired from the billions of trees in the lowland Amazon, moves west and up the mountain slopes of the Andes, some of it condenses and falls as rain. Some remain in the form of low clouds and mist, which condenses directly onto the foliage of cloud forest trees. Cloud forests extend from about 3,000 feet in elevation up to about 8,000 feet, so temperatures tend to be cooler than in lowland rainforests. The terrain is often on steep slopes, with more open canopy, leading to more vegetation on the forest floor. These higher-elevation forests are characterized by waterfalls and quick-moving, shallow rivers. Cloud forest trees are often covered in plants called epiphytes, which capture much of the moisture found in cloud forests. Clouds and mist condense on the epiphytes' leaves and pool at the bases of epiphytes (providing habitat for insects and some types of frogs). Trees here are generally shorter than in lowland rainforest, hence the cloud forest tree canopy is lower. Nature and Culture is currently working with local communities and authorities in our North Andes Mosaic to protect highland forest in Peru which is essential for providing water resources to over two million people who live in the region. Amazon: Tropical rainforest east of the Andes The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical forest on Earth, with the highest density of plant and animal species anywhere. This lowland rainforest is east of the Andes mountain range and spans eight South American countries. The Amazon is impressively large, more than double the size of the next two largest rainforests combined. It is also well known for its mighty Amazon River which is made up of 1,100 tributaries, including the Maranon River which is considered the source of the Amazon in Peru. The province of Loreto, Peru, is facing the second-highest rate of deforestation in Peru. Nature and Culture is currently partnering with Indigenous communities and local authorities through sustainable livelihood projects in our Nanay-Tigre Mosaic. Choco: Coastal rainforest west of the Andes On a strip of forest in western Colombia and Northwestern Ecuador, between the Pacific Ocean and the Andean mountain range is the Choco forest. It is a dense and diverse tropical rainforest that blends with adjoining mangrove forests, rocky cliffs, and coastal plains. It is one of the world's wettest rainforests and one of the most biologically rich areas in the world. Many species here cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, such as the golden poison frog (one of the three most poisonous vertebrates in the world). Between two to three percent of this ecosystem is left, making it one of the most threatened and lesser-known forests in the world. With Nature and Culture International's support, the Bajo Baudo protected area was established in 2018. This is the largest regional protected area ever created in Colombia. We are currently working in our Southern Choco Mosaic to declare two new protected areas and establish sustainable management plans. Why we protect rainforests Although rainforests only cover 6 percent of our planet, an estimated 80 percent of terrestrial animals, plants, and fungi species worldwide live within them. Many species have not yet even been described by science. Rainforests contain a huge amount of biodiversity, which has major implications for our health, including improving mental well-being, preventing zoonotic diseases (diseases transmitted from animals to humans - e.g. West Nile virus, Lyme Disease, and some types of coronaviruses, among many others) from entering human populations, and providing fresh water, clean air, and vital medicines. Indigenous peoples have lived in and sustainably managed tropical rainforests for centuries, if not millennia. Many Indigenous communities are reliant upon the natural resources that the rainforest provides, particularly clean water. By destroying rainforests, humans are exacerbating the climate crisis by releasing additional CO2 into the atmosphere. All rainforests have a huge volume of carbon stored in the vast amount of vegetation they house. There is so much carbon stored in these ecosystems that, if released, it would not be able to be restored by the 2050 global goal of reaching net-zero emissions; this is known as ""Irrecoverable Carbon"". For World Rainforest Day and every day, it is important to support rainforest conservation and raise awareness of the threats they face.

Rainforest covers the largest part of the Amazon region, most of the Guianas, southern and eastern Venezuela, the Atlantic slopes of the Brazilian Highlands, and the Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Ecuador. The Amazon region is the largest and probably the oldest forest area in the world; it also ascends the slopes of the Andes until it merges with subtropical and temperate regions. On its southern border it mixes with the woodlands of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, with galleries of trees extending along the rivers. Consisting of enormous trees, some exceeding a height of 300 feet (90 metres), the rainforest is composed of an almost incredible number of species growing side by side in the greatest profusion and arranged in different strata. There are about 2,500 species of Amazonian trees. In the region of Manaus, Brazil, for example, 1,652 plants belonging to 107 species in 37 different families were found on about 1,900 square feet (180 square metres). The forests of the swamps (igapos), where the ground is inundated or very marshy throughout the year, cover the lowlands. Characteristic trees are, among others, jacareubas (Calophyllum brasiliense), which is a tall tree with hard reddish brown wood used for heavy construction, araparis (Macrolobium acaciaefolium), abiuranas (Lucuma species), piranheiras (Piranhea trifoliata), and louros-do-igapo (Nectandra amazonum). Undergrowth is dense. In the annually flooded plains known as varzeas, trees are higher and quite diversified; they include oeiranas (Alchornea castaneifolia), a euphorbia (i.e., characterized by a milky juice), and the trumpet tree (Cecropia peltata), a rapid-growing tree of the mulberry family with a light wood. Palms and hevea (wild rubber plants) grow in those forests. The forests of the nonswampy areas are rich in hardwoods, of which acapu (a tree with dark brown wood), pau-amarelo (Euxylophora paraensis), pau-santo (Zollernia paraensis), massaranduba (a Brazilian tree with light reddish brown wood), jarana (a tree with hard, heavy, durable wood), and matamata (a tree with hard, heavy, durable wood, used for pilings) are the best known. Hevea and the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) are characteristic of those forests where spiny palms cover the ground. Epiphytes (nonparasitic plants that grow on other plants, deriving moisture and nutrients from rain and air) are numerous, mostly Bromeliaceae (a family having spiny leaves), orchids, and ferns. Lianas abound, particularly in drier forests.",1,1,5,1

Jimmy Choo is a British luxury fashion house specialising in shoes, handbags, accessories and fragrances. The company, J. Choo Limited, was founded in 1996 by Malaysian Chinese couture shoe designer Jimmy Choo and British Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. The brand claims to have been a favourite of Diana, Princess of Wales. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired in November 2017 by Michael Kors Holdings, now Capri Holdings. == History == === Foundation (late eighties to 1996) === The brand traces its roots to shoemaker Jimmy Choo who had set up his workshop in the late 1980s out of the converted Metropolitan Free Hospital in the East End of London. He was distributing his shoes at a stall of the local market. He was known by the editors of fashion industry magazines because he could recreate Manolo Blahnik's high-heeled shoes in different colours. Sandra Choi, Choo's wife's niece, joined him in 1989 and quickly became in charge of designing the shoes. In the early 1990s, Choo catered to the global jet set, including Diana, Princess of Wales. ""Choo first met Diana [in 1991] when he was summoned to Kensington Palace by the princess after his name across in the Press. 'I was so excited I could not sleep the whole night. In fact I was so scared of oversleeping that I practically stay awaked.' [...] The subsequent meetings were even less formal and they soon became great friends."" The first ready-to-wear shoes were sold in September 1992 at the Gina store on 42 Sloane Street. In the early nineties, Jimmy Choo met with Tamara Mellon who, as a Vogue fashion assistant, would often ask Jimmy's help in customising shoes. After she quit Vogue, Tamara proposed in 1995 to Choo to develop a luxury, ready-to-wear line of shoes. The company was founded in May 1996 when Tom and Ann Yeardye decided to fund their daughter's idea by investing £150,000 in return for 50% of Jimmy Choo Limited and the right to use the name Jimmy Choo. Tamara was made President, Tom chairman. === Bootstrapping celebrities (1996-2001) === On July 5, 1998, Choo is mentioned in the fifth episode of HBO's Sex and the City: this marked the launch of a celebrity-driven go-to-market model. It confirmed the need to open a US store fast: this was done in November 1998. Following this opening, Tamara Mellon, Sandra Choi, and Marilyn Heston's Get Good Ink PR agency continued to work on the celebrities angle by making a large showing at the Academy Awards in March 1999: they dyed the Jimmy Choos they were loaning to actresses for the Oscars night in colours that matched their dresses. These years were also marked by a growing tension between Choo and Tamara Mellon, with Tom Yeardye often acting as the calming agent. Choo was more interested in couture shoe making whereas the Yeardyes wanted to scale ready-to-wear: ""I love the idea of couture and its emphasis on creation. [...] I leave the ready-to-wear to my partner and team."" A pair of couture shoes would take two weeks to manufacture with the assistance of eight people. In 1998, Choo moved his couture workshop from Hackney to 18 Connaught Street. Tom offered to buy Choo out but the latter refused to sell. === Phoenix / Equinox (2001-2004) === Robert Bensoussan, former director of sales for Sonia Rykiel (1986–89), director of international sales for Escada (1990–92), CEO of Christian Lacroix (1993–97) and Gianfranco Ferré (1999-2000) called Tamara Mellon in April 2001 to ""convince her that he was the one who could take the business to the next level"". Bensoussan contacted David Burns, the head of the consumer, leisure and retail practice of Phoenix Equity Partners to set up with them ""a new investment vehicle, Equity Luxury Holdings, which would invest in other UK brands that. like Jimmy Choo, could be developed."" The investment committee of Phoenix Equity considered the investment proposal on September 11, 2001. The terrorist attacks suspended the transaction. A couple of wee

News * Early settlement and growth Origins Although the region has been inhabited since prehistoric times, the oldest known reference to Brussels dates to the 10th century, when it had the Frankish name Bruocsella, which means ""settlement in the marshes."" The settlement at that time was a part of Lower Lotharingia, or Lower Lorraine, which later became known as the duchy of Brabant. Brussels owes its development to its location on the Senne (Flemish: Zenne) River, which flows from south to north, and an east-west economic route linking towns on the Rhine, such as Cologne (now in Germany), with Brugge (French: Bruges), Ieper (French: Ypres), and other towns in the county of Flanders. At the point where road and river crossed, a market and bartering place developed under the protection of the dukes of Brabant. By the 12th century, Brussels was surrounded by defensive ramparts with towers and fortified gateways. During the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries, Brussels grew to become one of the major towns of the duchy of Brabant. Its economic mainstay was the manufacture of luxury fabrics, which were exported to fairs in Paris, Venice, the Champagne region of France, and elsewhere. The cloth trade made fortunes for a few enterprising merchant families, who developed into seven dynasties that, with the help of the duke of Brabant, acquired a position of complete political mastery. In control of business and municipal affairs, they also exercised power as magistrates, giving rulings on disputes arising among the inhabitants, as well as acting as a court of appeal for neighbouring areas. The prevailing regime was, in fact, strongly plutocratic in nature. Abuse of such powers provoked violent popular uprisings in 1280, 1303, 1360, and 1421. This last upheaval led to a more equitable system of government, with local powers divided between the patrician families and the emergent guilds of craftsmen and other workers. Gradually, however, the patrician elite regained political control; as late as 1719 a popular revolt led by Frans Anneessens ended with his public execution. Centuries of occupation Events of particular significance in the 14th century were the invasion of the duchy of Brabant by troops of the count of Flanders, their brief occupation of Brussels, and the construction--immediately after the town's liberation--of huge fortified walls (1357-79), which survived until the first half of the 19th century. In 1430 the duchy was merged with the possessions of the duke of Burgundy. The Burgundian period, which lasted until 1477, was one of political and artistic prestige. Brussels became the seat of the central administrative bodies for the ducal possessions in the Low Countries, which constituted a rich centre of art and culture. Pictures by Rogier van der Weyden (the officially appointed town painter), sculptures in wood, large tapestries with historical motifs, plate, jewelry, and other products by Brussels craftsmen came to be exported in all directions. Brussels began to beautify itself: near the marketplace, the Town Hall (1402-54) rose proudly, with its tall perforated steeple surmounted by a statue of the archangel Michael, the city's patron saint. Various Gothic churches and cathedrals and the ducal Coudenberg Palace (destroyed in the 18th century), with its extensive park, added to the architectural splendour. After a prolonged political crisis caused by an abortive rebellion against the future Holy Roman emperorMaximilian I at the end of the 15th century, Brussels regained its position as a capital during the reign of Charles V (1519-56), who as Holy Roman emperor and king of Spain ruled a vast empire that included the Low Countries. Charles's three government councils (the Council of State, the Privy Council, and the Finance Council) were established permanently in Brussels, and the city's population grew to nearly 50,000 by the mid-16th century. In 1561 a canal linking Brussels with Willebroek was dug, providing direct access to the Rupel and the Schelde rivers and thus to the port of Antwerp and the North Sea. Replacing the sandy little Senne River, the Willebroek Canal played an important commercial role. The Reformation did not leave Brussels untouched. Two Lutheran preachers, the first Protestant martyrs in the Low Countries, died there at the stake in 1523, and many more Lutherans, Anabaptists, and Calvinists followed. During the revolt of the Low Countries against their Spanish Habsburg rulers (seeEighty Years' War), Brussels was under Calvinist rule from 1578 until 1585. By the latter date, however, the southern provinces of the Low Countries (which included modern-day Belgium) had separated from the northern provinces (now the Kingdom of the Netherlands), surrendered to the Spanish Habsburgs, and returned to the Roman Catholic fold. Brussels thus remained part of the Spanish-held southern provinces, or Spanish Netherlands, into the 18th century. The Counter-Reformation and the reign of Archduke Albert VII and Isabella (1598-1633) left their mark on the urban surroundings with the construction of a series of fine churches in the Italo-Flemish Baroque style, nearly all of which are still in existence. In the second half of the 17th century, there were repeated invasions by the armies of Louis XIV of France. During a bombardment by his troops in 1695, hundreds of buildings were destroyed by fire, including the various craft headquarters. Out of this catastrophe there arose new guildhalls, the architectural landmarks now surrounding the Grand' Place (Grote Markt). With control of the Spanish Netherlands passing to the Austrian Habsburgs in 1713, Brussels became part of the Austrian Netherlands. Under Austrian rule the city suffered a brief but costly occupation by French troops in 1746-48 but profited from the general economic recovery in the latter half of the 18th century, becoming a financial centre and gaining new industries. The upper part of the town was the scene of urban planning on a large scale, which resulted in the Place Royale and Brussels Park. Following the Brabant Revolution (1789-90) against the government of Holy Roman emperor Joseph II, the French republican armies made their appearance, and the Belgian principalities were annexed to France. During the Napoleonic era, Brussels was reduced to the rank of chief town of the French departement of the Dyle, losing in addition all authority over its satellite villages. (SeeFrench revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.) One of the consequences of Napoleon I's defeat at Waterloo (1815) was the creation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This reunion of the southern and northern provinces, which had been separated in the 16th century, lasted 15 years (1815-30). During this period Brussels shared the status of capital with The Hague. Its appearance changed appreciably, above all because of the demolition of the city walls (1810-40) and their replacement by tree-lined boulevards, as well as the digging of the Brussels-Charleroi Canal, which from 1832 onward made waterborne transport possible from as far as the province of Hainaut to the port of Antwerp via the capital. In 1830 came revolution; Belgium won its independence, and, in the constitution adopted by the newly elected National Congress, Brussels, which had played a major role in the uprising against the Kingdom of the Netherlands, was named the capital of Belgium and the seat of government. The Brussels elite remained predominant in Belgian national politics throughout the 19th century. Meanwhile, the city's growing political and administrative role enhanced its importance as an economic and financial centre. With a population of more than 123,000 in 1846, it became the central node of Belgium's road and railway network. Its material infrastructure was greatly improved by means of a modern sewerage and water-supply system, the introduction of public transport, and the development of new residential districts. However, as suburban areas were incorporated into the agglomeration, the fragmented local administration was streamlined only partly and gradually.

87,what do portuguese people speak?,Portuguese,Portuguese,"Portuguese Culture and Language The poet Fernando Pessoa once wrote that ""My homeland is the Portuguese language"". And today, more than 200 million people, spread out throughout Europe, Africa, South America and Asia, share that homeland, called Portuguese Language. Portuguese is currently the fifth most spoken language in the world and an official language of Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe and East Timor. It is also used in Macau, territory under Portuguese administration until 1999, and in Goa. It is also the base of around twenty Creole languages and an important minority language in countries such as Andorra, Luxemburg, Namibia, Switzerland and South Africa, due to the numerous Portuguese communities in those countries. It is this universality of the Portuguese language that unites Portuguese, Brazilians, many Africans and some Asians, through the recognition of the Portuguese language as a common cultural heritage. Due to not having a continuous territory, but vast separate regions spread over several continents, and the fact that it is not exclusive to one community, but is felt as its own, equally, in distant communities, the language manifests a great internal diversity, depending on the regions and groups that use it. A language of culture like the Portuguese language, bearer of a long history which is both the raw material and product of several literatures and an instrument of global affirmation of several societies, is not exhausted in the description of its linguistic system: a language such as this lives in history, in society and in the world. It has an existence motivated and conditioned by the great human movements and, at present, through the existence of the groups that speak it. This means that the Portuguese spoken all around the world, meanwhile harmonized by an important Orthographic Agreement, continues to be felt as a single language, a vehicle of communication by excellency and perhaps the most powerful of the ties uniting the countries that use it.

Brazilian Portuguese varies from European Portuguese in several respects, including several sound changes and some differences in verb conjugation and syntax; for example, object pronouns occur before the verb in Brazilian Portuguese, as in Spanish, but after the verb in standard Portuguese. Despite differences in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, Portuguese is often mutually intelligible with Spanish.There are four main Portuguese dialect groups, all mutually intelligible: (1) Central, or Beira, (2) Southern (Estremenho), including Lisbon, Alentejo, and Algarve, (3) Insular, including the dialects of Madeira and the Azores, and (4) Brazilian. Standard Portuguese was developed in the 16th century, basically from the dialects spoken from Lisbon to Coimbra. Brazilian (Brasileiro) differs from the Portuguese spoken in Portugal in several respects, in syntax as well as phonology and vocabulary, but many writers still use an academic metropolitan standard. A Judeo-Portuguese is attested in 18th-century Amsterdam and Livorno (Leghorn, Italy), but virtually no trace of that dialect remains today. Typical of the Portuguese sound system is the use of nasal vowels, indicated in the orthography by m or n following the vowel (e.g., sim 'yes,' bem 'well') or by the use of a tilde (~) over the vowel (mao 'hand,' nacao 'nation'). In grammar its verb system is quite different from that of Spanish. Portuguese has a conjugated or personal infinitive and a future subjunctive and uses the verb ter (Latin tenere, Spanish tener 'to have,' 'to hold') as an auxiliary verb instead of haver (Latin habere, Spanish haber 'to have'; in Spanish used only as an auxiliary verb). Until the 15th century, Portuguese and Galician formed one single linguistic unit, Gallego-Portuguese. The first evidence for the language consists of scattered words in 9th-12th-century Latin texts; continuous documents date from approximately 1192, the date assigned to an extant property agreement between the children of a well-to-do family from the Minho River valley. Literature began to flourish especially during the 13th and 14th centuries, when the soft Gallego-Portuguese tongue was preferred by courtly lyric poets throughout the Iberian Peninsula except in the Catalan area. In the 16th century, Portugal's golden age, Galician and Portuguese grew farther apart, with the consolidation of the standard Portuguese language. From the 16th to the 18th century, Galician was used only as a home language (i.e., as a means of communication within the family). Toward the end of the 18th century, it was revived as a language of culture. In the 21st century, with Spanish, it is an official language of the comunidad autonoma (""autonomous community"") of Galicia. In 2008 the Portuguese parliament passed an act mandating the use of a standardized orthography based on Brazilian forms.

The Portuguese people (Portuguese: Portugueses – masculine – or Portuguesas) is a Romance-speaking ethnic group and nation indigenous to Portugal, a country that occupies the west side of the Iberian Peninsula in south-west Europe, who share culture, ancestry and language. The Portuguese state began with the founding of the County of Portugal in 868. Following the Battle of São Mamede (1128), Portugal gained international recognition as a kingdom through the Treaty of Zamora and the papal bull Manifestis Probatum. This Portuguese state paved the way for the Portuguese people to unite as a nation. The Portuguese explored distant lands previously unknown to Europeans—in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania (southwest Pacific Ocean). In 1415, with the conquest of Ceuta, the Portuguese took a significant role in the Age of Discovery, which culminated in a colonial empire. It was one of the first global empires and one of the world's major economic, political and military powers in the 15th and 16th centuries, with territories that became part numerous countries. Portugal helped to launch the spread of Western civilization to other geographies. During and after the period of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese diaspora spread across the world. == Ancestry == The Portuguese people's heritage largely derives from the Indo-European (Lusitanians, Conii), and Celtic peoples (Gallaecians, Turduli and Celtici). They were later Romanized after the Roman conquest. The Portuguese language–the native language of the overwhelming majority of Portuguese people–stems from Vulgar Latin. A number of male Portuguese lineages descend from Germanic tribes who arrived as ruling elites after the Roman period, starting in 409. These included the Suebi, Buri, Hasdingi Vandals and Visigoths. The pastoral North Caucasus' Alans left traces in a few central-southern areas (e.g. Alenquer, from ""Alen Kerke"" or ""Temple of the Alans""). The Umayyad conquest of Iberia, between the early 8th century until the 12th century, also left small Moorish, Jewish and Saqaliba genetic contributions. Other minor – as well as later – influences include small Viking settlements between the 9th and 11th centuries, made by Norsemen who raided coastal areas mainly in the northern regions of Douro and Minho. Low-incidence, pre-Roman influence came from Phoenicians and Greeks in southern coastal areas. == Name == The name Portugal is a portmanteau that comes from the Latin word Portus (meaning port) and a second word Cale, whose meaning and origin are unclear. Cale is probably a reminder of the Gallaeci (also known as Callaeci), a Celtic tribe that lived in part of Northern Portugal. Alternatively the name may have come from the early settlement of Cale (today's Gaia), situated on the mouth of the Douro River on the Atlantic coast (Portus Cale). The name Cale seems to come from the Celts – perhaps from one of their specifications, Cailleach – but which, in everyday life, was synonymous with shelter, anchorage or door. Among other theories, some suggest that Cale may stem from the Greek word for kalós (beautiful). Another theory for Portugal postulates a French derivation, Portus Gallus ""port of the Gauls"". During the Middle Ages, the area around Cale became known through the Visigoths as Portucale. Portucale could have evolved in the 7th and 8th centuries, to become Portugale, or Portugal, from the 9th century. The term denoted the area between the Douro and Minho rivers. == Early inhabitants == Portuguese origins are predominantly from Southern and Western Europe. The earliest modern humans inhabiting Portugal are believed to have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Y-chromosome and mtDNA data suggest that modern Portuguese trace a proportion of these lineages to the paleolithic peoples who began settling the European continent at the end of the last glaciation around 45,000 years ago.

The permanent members were all Allies in World War II (and the victors of that war), and are the five states with the first and most nuclear weapons. All have the power of veto which enables any one of them to prevent the adoption of any ""substantive"" draft Council resolution, regardless of its level of international support. The remaining 10 members of the UN Security Council are elected by the General Assembly, giving a total of 15 UN member states on the Security Council, which convenes meetings at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City. == Permanent members == The following is a table of the current permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. == History == Based on the consensus concerning the Security Council's structure agreed upon at the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conference and subsequently at UN's founding in 1945, the five permanent members of the Security Council were the French Republic, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There have been two seat changes since then, although these have not been reflected in Article 23 of the UN Charter, as it has not been accordingly amended: China's seat was originally held by the Nationalist government of the Republic of China (ROC). However, it lost the Chinese Civil War and retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949. The Chinese Communist Party won control of Mainland China and established the People's Republic of China (PRC). In 1971, UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 recognised the PRC as the legal representative of China in the UN, and gave it the seat on the Security Council that had been held by the ROC, which was expelled from the UN altogether. Both the ROC and the PRC continue to claim de jure sovereignty over the entirety of China (including Taiwan). However, only 13 states continue to officially recognise the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia was recognised as the legal successor state of the Soviet Union and maintained the latter's position on the Security Council. Additionally, between the founding of the United Nations and the end of the 20th century, many of the overseas territories of the United Kingdom and France became independent with the breakup of the British Empire and French colonial empire, and France had a reduction in de jure territory with the independence of Algeria in 1962. France maintained its seat as there was no change in its international status or recognition. (During this time, France also reformed its provisional government into the French Fourth Republic in 1946 and into the French Fifth Republic in 1958, both under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle.) The five permanent members of the Security Council were the victorious powers in World War II and have maintained the world's most powerful military forces ever since. They annually top the list of countries with the highest military expenditures along with India and Germany; in 2011, they spent over US$1 trillion combined on defence, accounting for over 60% of global military expenditures (the US alone accounting for over 40%). They are also among the world's top 10 largest arms exporters and are the only nations officially recognised as ""nuclear-weapon states"" under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), though there are other states known or believed to be in possession of nuclear weapons. == Veto power == The ""power of veto"" refers to the veto power wielded solely by the permanent members, enabling them to prevent the adoption of any ""substantive"" draft Council resolution, regardless of the level of international support for the draft.

Non-Council Member States More than 50 United Nations Member States have never been Members of the Security Council. A State which is a Member of the United Nations but not of the Security Council may participate, without a vote, in its discussions when the Council considers that country's interests are affected. Both Members and non-members of the United Nations, if they are parties to a dispute being considered by the Council, may be invited to take part, without a vote, in the Council's discussions; the Council sets the conditions for participation by a non-member State.

In early 2011, amid a wave of popular protest in countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa, largely peaceful demonstrations against entrenched regimes brought quick transfers of power in Egypt and Tunisia. In Libya, however, an uprising against the four-decade rule of Muammar al-Qaddafi led to civil war and international military intervention. In this special feature, Britannica provides a guide to recent events in Libya and explores the historical and geographic context of the conflict. Uprising On February 15, 2011, anti-government rallies were held in Benghazi by protesters angered by the arrest of a human rights lawyer, Fethi Tarbel. The protesters called for Qaddafi to step down and for the release of political prisoners. Libyan security forces used water cannons and rubber bullets against the crowds, resulting in a number of injuries. To counter the demonstrations further, a pro-government rally orchestrated by the Libyan authorities was broadcast on state television. As the protests intensified, with demonstrators taking control of Benghazi and unrest spreading to Tripoli, the Libyan government began using lethal force against demonstrators. Security forces and squads of mercenaries fired live ammunition into crowds of demonstrators. Demonstrators also were attacked with tanks and artillery and from the air with warplanes and helicopter gunships. The regime restricted communications, blocking the Internet and interrupting telephone service throughout the country. On February 21 one of Qaddafi's sons, Sayf al-Islam, gave a defiant address on state television, blaming outside agitators for the unrest and saying that further demonstrations could lead to civil war in the country. He vowed that the regime would fight ""to the last bullet."" The government's sudden escalation of violence against protesters and other civilians drew international condemnation from foreign leaders and human rights organizations. It also seemed to damage the coherence of the regime, causing a number of high-level officials--including the minister of justice and a number of senior Libyan diplomats, including the Libyan ambassador to the United Nations--to resign in protest or issue statements condemning the regime. A number of Libyan embassies around the world began to fly Libya's pre-Qaddafi flag, signaling support for the uprising. Support for Qaddafi also seemed to waver in some segments of the military; as the Libyan air force carried out attacks against demonstrators, two Libyan fighter pilots flew their jets to Malta, choosing to defect rather than obey orders to bomb Benghazi. On February 22 Qaddafi delivered an angry, rambling speech on state television, condemning the protesters as traitors and calling on his supporters to fight them. The speech took place in the Bab al-'Aziziyyah compound, Qaddafi's primary headquarters in Tripoli, in front of a building that still showed extensive damage from a 1986 air strike by the United States. He resisted calls to step down and vowed to remain in Libya. Although he denied having used force against protesters, he repeatedly vowed to use violence to remain in power. Clashes continued, and Qaddafi's hold on power weakened as Libyan military units increasingly sided with the opposition against the regime. As demonstrators acquired weapons from government arms depots and joined forces with defected military units, the anti-Qaddafi movement began to take the form of an armed rebellion. The newly armed rebel forces were able to expel most pro-Qaddafi troops from the eastern portion of Libya, including the city of Benghazi, and many western cities by February 23. The Libyan-Egyptian border was opened, allowing foreign journalists into the country for the first time since the conflict began. Pro-Qaddafi paramilitary units continued to hold the city of Tripoli, where Qaddafi and members of his family and inner circle remained. As Qaddafi massed his forces in the Tripoli area to hold off the rebels there, his public statements seemed to indicate that he was becoming increasingly isolated and desperate. Speaking by telephone on Libyan state television on February 24, Qaddafi once again lashed out at protesters, saying that the young people at the core of the protest movement were acting under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs and that the demonstrations were being controlled by al-Qaeda. Foreign leaders continued to condemn the violence. However, international efforts to intervene or pressure the regime to end the bloodshed were complicated by the presence of many foreign nationals in Libya still waiting to be evacuated. The regime continued its efforts to hold the capital, launching attacks around Tripoli, some of which were repelled by rebel forces. On February 25 pro-Qaddafi gunmen in Tripoli attacked unarmed protesters and others as they emerged from mosques after Friday prayers. International pressure for Qaddafi to step down increased as violence continued and foreign nationals were evacuated. The UN Security Council unanimously approved a measure that included exacting sanctions against the Qaddafi regime, imposing a travel ban and an arms embargo, and freezing the Qaddafi family's assets. The measure also referred the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The United States, the European Union (EU), and a number of other countries also imposed sanctions. On February 28 the United States announced that it had frozen at least $30 billion in Libyan assets. Amid continuing skirmishes as rebel forces strengthened their positions outside Tripoli, Qaddafi invited a number of Western journalists to the city in an attempt to demonstrate that the situation remained under control in the capital. In interviews he continued to blame al-Qaeda and hallucinogenic drugs for the uprising. He claimed that Western leaders who had called for him to step down had done so out of a desire to colonize Libya, and he insisted that he was still well loved by Libyans. A rebel leadership council, formed by the merger of local rebel groups, appeared in Benghazi in early March. Known as the Transitional National Council (TNC), it declared that its aims would be to act as the rebellion's military leadership and as the representative of the Libyan opposition, provide services in rebel-held areas, and guide the country's transition to democratic government. Conditions in Libya worsened as the armed struggle continued, and thousands of people, mostly migrant workers from Egypt and Tunisia, fled toward the borders. Governments and humanitarian organizations began to organize efforts to address worsening shortages of food, fuel, and medical supplies throughout the country. Benghazi, Libya: protests in 2011Protesters at a rally in Benghazi in March 2011 carrying the Libyan flag that was used from 1951 to 1969. The flag was adopted by the rebels in 2011. After the rebels succeeded in taking control of eastern Libya and a number of cities in the west, the conflict appeared to enter a stalemate. The Qaddafi regime still controlled enough soldiers and weapons to hold Tripoli and to stage fresh assaults, which rebel fighters, although poorly equipped, were largely able to repel. Most fighting took place in the towns around Tripoli and in the central coastal region, where rebels and Qaddafi loyalists battled for control of the oil-export terminals on the Gulf of Sidra. As the fighting continued, forces loyal to Qaddafi seemed to gain momentum, launching successful assaults to retake control in strategic areas around Tripoli and on the coast of the Gulf of Sidra. Attacking with fighter jets, tanks, and artillery, pro-Qaddafi forces had by March 10 driven rebel forces from Zawiyah, west of Tripoli, and from the oil-export centre of Ras Lanuf. Those gains highlighted the Qaddafi loyalists' advantages in weaponry, training, and organization. As Qaddafi appeared to gain the upper hand, the international community continued to debate possible diplomatic and military responses to the rapidly developing conflict. Countries worked to establish contact with the TNC, although only France granted it official recognition, announcing on March 10 that it would treat the council as Libya's legitimate government. International condemnation of the Qaddafi regime continued to build, and, at an emergency summit on March 11, the EU unanimously called for Qaddafi to step down. However, the international community remained divided over the possibility of military intervention--most likely by imposing a no-fly zone over Libya, a measure long requested by the rebels to prevent Qaddafi loyalists from launching air attacks. Some countries, including France and the United Kingdom, signaled their support for such an operation, while others, including the United States and Germany, expressed their reservations, emphasizing the need for broad international consensus and warning against possible unforeseen consequences of military intervention. The African Union (AU) rejected any military intervention in Libya, asserting that the crisis should be resolved through negotiations, whereas the Arab League passed a resolution on March 13 calling on the UN Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya. On March 15 Qaddafi loyalists launched a heavy assault on the eastern city of Ajdabiya, the last large rebel-held city on the route to Benghazi. On March 17, as Qaddafi loyalists advanced on the remaining rebel positions in Benghazi and Tobruk in the east and Misurata in the west, the UN Security Council voted 10-0--with abstentions from Russia, China, Germany, India, and Brazil--to authorize military action, including imposition of a no-fly zone to protect Libyan civilians. The Qaddafi regime responded by declaring an immediate cease-fire, although there were reports that pro-Qaddafi forces continued to launch attacks after the announcement and that heavy fighting continued in Benghazi. Beginning March 19, a coalition of U.S. and European forces with warplanes and cruise missiles attacked targets in Libya in an effort to disable Libya's air force and air defense systems so that the UN-authorized no-fly zone could be imposed. Coalitionmissiles struck buildings in a compound used by Qaddafi as a command centre, and in eastern Libya warplanes attacked a pro-Qaddafi armoured column positioned outside Benghazi. Emboldened by the air strikes, rebel forces once again launched an offensive to challenge pro-Qaddafi forces' hold on the oil centres on the coast. Qaddafi denounced the coalition attacks as an act of aggression against Libya and vowed to continue fighting international forces and the rebels. Coalition spokesmen announced on March 23 that the Libyan air force had been completely disabled by coalition air strikes. However, heavy fighting continued on the ground. Pro-Qaddafi units massed around the rebel-held city of Misurata in the west and the contested city of Ajdabiya in the east, shelling both heavily and causing significant civilian casualties. Attacks by coalition warplanes soon weakened pro-Qaddafi ground forces in eastern Libya, allowing rebels to advance west again. On March 27 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) officially took command of military operations previously directed by the United States, France, and the United Kingdom in Libya. The handover came after several days of debate between NATO countries over the limits of international military intervention; several countries had argued that the coalition's aggressive targeting of pro-Qaddafi ground forces had exceeded the mandate set by the UN Security Council to protect civilians. On March 30 Libyan foreign minister Moussa Koussa defected, fleeing to the United Kingdom. The defection of Koussa, a former head of Libyan intelligence and a longtime member of Qaddafi's inner circle, was interpreted as a sign that support for Qaddafi among senior Libyan officials was beginning to wane. As the fighting progressed, it began to appear that, even with NATO attacks on pro-Qaddafi forces, the Libyan rebels--a poorly armed and disorganized force with little military training--would be unable to oust Qaddafi or achieve decisive successes against Qaddafi's professional troops. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis intensified, with an AU delegation traveling to Tripoli on April 10 to present a cease-fire plan to Qaddafi. AU representatives announced that Qaddafi had accepted the plan, although pro-Qaddafi forces continued to launch attacks on April 11. The plan was rejected by the rebel leaders on the grounds that it did not provide for Qaddafi's departure from Libya. As the stalemate continued, the United Kingdom announced on April 19 that it would send a team of military liaison officers to Libya to advise rebel leaders on military strategy, organization, and logistics. The next day France and Italy announced that they would also send advisers. All three countries specified that their officers would not participate in fighting. The Libyan foreign minister condemned the decision to send military advisers, saying that such aid to the rebels would only prolong the conflict. NATO attacks continued and targeted a number of sites associated with Qaddafi and members of his inner circle, such as the Bab al-'Aziziyyah compound in Tripoli, drawing protests from Libyan officials who charged that NATO had adopted a strategy of trying to kill Qaddafi. His son Sayf al-Arab and three of Qaddafi's grandchildren were killed in a NATO air strike in April. In June the ICC issued arrest warrants for Qaddafi, his son Sayf al-Islam, and the Libyan intelligence chief, Abdullah Senussi, for ordering attacks against civilians during the uprising. Some observers expressed concern that the ICC's proceedings against Qaddafi would discourage him from relinquishing power voluntarily. In spite of pressure from NATO attacks, rebel advances in the eastern and western regions of Libya, and the Qaddafi regime's international isolation, Qaddafi continued to hold power in Tripoli. After months of stalemate, the balance of power once again shifted in the rebels' favour. In August 2011 rebel forces advanced to the outskirts of Tripoli, taking control of strategic areas, including the city of Zawiyah, the site of one of Libya's largest oil refineries. Rebels soon advanced into Tripoli, establishing control over some areas of the capital on August 22. As rebel fighters battled pro-Qaddafi forces for control of Tripoli, Qaddafi's whereabouts were unknown. The next day rebel forces appeared to gain the upper hand, capturing the Bab al-'Aziziyyah compound, Qaddafi's headquarters. Rebels raised Libya's pre-Qaddafi flag over the compound as jubilant crowds destroyed symbols of Qaddafi. Fighting between rebels and loyalists continued in a few areas of Tripoli. By early September rebel forces had solidified their control of Tripoli, and the TNC began to transfer its operations to the capital. Qaddafi, effectively forced from power, remained in hiding, occasionally issuing defiant audio messages. Rebel forces focused their attention on the few remaining cities under loyalist control, attempting to use negotiations to persuade loyalist commanders to surrender peacefully and avoid a bloody ground assault. When negotiations failed, rebel troops began to push into the cities of Sirte and Bani Walid, engaging in heavy fighting with loyalists. The TNC achieved new international legitimacy on September 15 when the UN General Assembly voted to recognize it as the representative of the Libyan people in the UN. On October 20 Qaddafi was discovered and killed by rebel fighters in his hometown, Sirte, as they fought to solidify their control of the city. The TNC struggled to establish a functional government and exert its authority in the months that followed the fall of the Qaddafi regime. Local rebel militias that had fought autonomously during the uprising, especially those in western Libya, were reluctant to submit to an interim government formed in eastern Libya with little input from the rest of the country and were suspicious of some TNC officials' past ties to the Qaddafi regime. The militias refused to disarm, and skirmishes between rival militias over territory were common.

What We Do in the Shadows is an American comedy horror mockumentary fantasy television series created by Jemaine Clement, first broadcast on FX on March 27, 2019. The series follows four vampire roommates on Staten Island, and stars Kayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, Harvey Guillén, Mark Proksch, and Kristen Schaal. Based on the 2014 New Zealand film of the same name, written by Clement and Taika Waititi, it is the second television series in the franchise. The show was renewed for a sixth and final season, that premiered on October 21, 2024. It has been critically acclaimed (particularly for its cast and writing) and nominated for 29 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2020, 2022, and 2024, for its second, third and fifth season, respectively. == Premise == Traditional vampires Nandor, Laszlo, and Nadja, together with energy vampire Colin Robinson, share a Staten Island residence, maintained by Nandor's familiar Guillermo. The vampires routinely clash with the modern world, other supernatural beings, and/or each other, while Guillermo earnestly endeavors to balance his loyalty to Nandor with his desire to become a vampire, complicated by his ancestry as a descendant of vampire hunter Van Helsing. == Cast and characters == === Main === Kayvan Novak as Nandor the Relentless – Once the bloodthirsty leader of the fictional kingdom of Al-Quolanudar in southern Iran and a warrior serving the Ottoman Empire. At age 760, he is the oldest vampire and the self-proclaimed leader of the group, leading him to frequently calling house meetings for frivolous discussions. Although he genuinely cares for his human familiar Guillermo, he has difficulty expressing it. Nandor is also quite naïve to the ways of modern society and humans, which often results in Guillermo becoming frustrated with him. Matt Berry as Leslie ""Laszlo"" Cravensworth – A 310-year-old vampire from British nobility who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. A pansexual and former porn actor who is often preoccupied with sexual thoughts, he enjoys sexual encounters with both Nadja and Nandor. He also enjoys making topiary sculptures of vulvas in the yard, including those of his wife and mother. Natasia Demetriou as Nadja of Antipaxos – A 500-year-old Greek Romani vampire who turned Laszlo into a vampire and later married him. She is frequently frustrated with her male housemates and nostalgic about her human life. She has entertained an affair with a reincarnated knight named Gregor for hundreds of years, only for him to be decapitated in every reincarnation. She later becomes manager of her own vampire nightclub. Demetriou also plays Nadja's human ghost, split from its corporeal form when Nadja was turned into a vampire, who inhabits a doll which has appeared since the second season. Harvey Guillén as Guillermo de la Cruz – Nandor's long-suffering Latino familiar. Despite his frustration with his unreasonable workload and Nandor's disregard for his mortality, he has served his master for more than a decade in the hope of being made a vampire. Guillermo discovers that he is a descendant of the famous vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing and proves to be very skilled at killing vampires, giving him conflicting feelings about his desire to become a vampire. Guillermo's skill as a vampire slayer leads to him becoming a bodyguard for Nandor, Nadja, and Laszlo. He comes out as gay to his family but reveals his desire to become a vampire at the same time, prompting Nadja to erase their memories of his confession. Mark Proksch as Colin Robinson (and Baby Colin / ""The Boy"") – An energy vampire who lives in the basement. He sustains himself by draining humans and fellow vampires of their life force by being extremely boring or frustrating. As a ""day walker"", he is not harmed by sunlight or entry into churches, and thus holds a regular job in an office where he feeds on his coworkers' frustrations. This also means that he financially supports the

St Trinian's is a 2007 British comedy film and the sixth in a long-running series of British films based on the works of cartoonist Ronald Searle and set in St Trinian's School. The first five films form a series, starting with The Belles of St. Trinian's in 1954, with sequels in 1957, 1960, 1966 and a reboot in 1980. The release of 2007, 27 years after the last entry, and 53 years after the first film, is a rebooting of the franchise, rather than a direct sequel, with certain plot elements borrowed from the first film. Whereas the earlier films concentrated on the adults, this film gives the school pupils greater prominence. St Trinian's is an anarchic school for uncontrollable girls run by eccentric headmistress Camilla Dagey Fritton (the reboot continues the tradition, established by Alastair Sim in the original film, of casting a male actor to play the female headmistress, with Rupert Everett inheriting the role). St Trinian's received mixed reviews but remains one of the highest-grossing British independent films of the last thirty years. == Plot == Annabelle Fritton, an uptight daddy's girl, unwillingly transfers to St Trinian's from the distinguished Cheltenham Ladies' College at the request of her father, Carnaby Fritton. Annabelle is resentful and insulting, telling her father that the school is ""like Hogwarts for pikeys"". She is taken around the school by Kelly Jones, the head girl, who introduces her to the various cliques within the school; Chavs, Posh Totty, Geeks, Emo and First Years. Annabelle is harassed and pranked by the girls while in the shower and a video of her running around the school naked and wet is broadcast live on the internet. After a phone argument with her father she is drafted to the hockey team when she hits her phone with her hockey stick, smashing a statue. The girls of St Trinian's are involved in business with spiv Flash Harry, who pays them to make cheap vodka. Flash is shown to be romantically interested in Kelly, who initially turns him down. The Cheltenham Ladies' College hockey team arrive at St Trinian's, along with Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites. Thwaites is shown to have romantic history with the headmistress of St Trinian's, Camilla Fritton. Annabelle is forced to face her former bullies, including captain Verity Thwaites. The hockey match is violent, ending in Kelly shooting a winning goal for St Trinian's, and she begins to fit in with the other girls. As the match is being played, Thwaites inspects the school, finding the illegal vodka-making business and the chatline being run by the Posh Totty clique. The following morning, a banker arrives at the school and serves Camilla with a foreclosure notice, as the school owes the bank in excess of £500,000 and has ignored six previous final demands. A subsequent meeting between Camilla and Carnaby is watched by the girls using hidden cameras, in which Carnaby confesses his distaste towards his daughter. Annabelle is clearly upset, despite Camilla defending her. Carnaby encourages Camilla to turn the school into a boutique hotel, telling her that ""when this school closes down, you'll have lost everything. More importantly, so will I."" Kelly and Flash work with the students to devise a plan to save the school. They must get into the final of School Challenge, a TV quiz show held in the National Gallery in London, as a cover for stealing Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring. Chelsea, Peaches and Chloe (the Posh Totty clique) are chosen as the School Challenge Team. By cheating in every round, they make it to the grand final. As the final is being filmed, Kelly, Taylor and Andrea steal the painting, with help from the Geeks, Annabelle and Camilla herself. Camilla paints an exact copy of the painting and has Flash, posing as a German art dealer, sell it to Carnaby in a black market deal. The school then receives a further £50,000 reward for returning the real painting to the National Gallery. The loans are able to be repaid and the

The fourth season of the American television sitcom Cheers aired on NBC from September 26, 1985 to May 15, 1986. This season marks Woody Harrelson's television debut as Woody Boyd after Nicholas Colasanto, who portrayed Coach Ernie Pantusso, died during the previous season. The show was created by director James Burrows and writers Glen and Les Charles, under production team Charles Burrows Charles Productions, in association with Paramount Television. == Background == During the previous season, 1984–85, after two years of struggling with low ratings, rapid schedule changes, and failed series, NBC's Thursday night lineup (years before the Must See TV promotional slogan was developed) consisted of, in time slot order starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern / 7:00 p.m. Central: The Cosby Show, Family Ties, Cheers, Night Court, and Hill Street Blues, and became a ratings success for the network. The 1985–86 Thursday schedule was similar to the previous season's and was still a success. == Cast and characters == Ted Danson as Sam Malone — bartender, owner, retired Red Sox relief pitcher Shelley Long as Diane Chambers — snobby waitress, the moral compass of the bar staff and patrons Rhea Perlman as Carla Tortelli — bitter waitress, divorced mother of six. Gives birth to Ludlow, named after his father Dr. Bennett Ludlow, Frasier's mentor. John Ratzenberger as Cliff Clavin — postal carrier and virginal, loquacious bar know-it-all Woody Harrelson as Woody Boyd — dim small town Indiana bar-tender, hired by Sam to fill-in for the coach's absence following the latter's death. George Wendt as Norm Peterson — a semi-unemployed accountant, a childless husband Kelsey Grammer as Frasier Crane (recurring) — jilted psychiatrist Recurring and credited in the end credits, though appears in most episodes. In remastered prints of the episode ""Cliffie's Big Score"", seen on DVD and later syndication, Grammer's name appears in the opening credits, although he does not appear in the episode and is not officially credited in the opening until Season 5. During the previous season, Sam went to Italy to stop Frasier and Diane's wedding. This season, he fails to do so, and returns to Boston. Several months later, Frasier comes to the bar to announce that Diane jilted him at the altar, made love to other men, and is now in a convent, located one hour away from Boston. Sam retrieves Diane from the convent and rehires her as a bar waitress. After having lost everything, including his career, Frasier frequently visits the Boston bar, Cheers, for drinks and then slowly degenerates into alcoholism. He recovers, then begins another psychiatric job, distancing himself from Sam and Diane's relationship. Sam then begins a relationship with the city councillor Janet Eldrige (Kate Mulgrew). Tired of being part the triangle with Sam and Diane, Janet breaks up with Sam. In the season's finale, during a telephone call, Sam proposes to an unidentified woman. == Episodes == == Production == During filming of the series' third season, Nicholas Colasanto, who portrayed regular character Coach Ernie Pantusso, died of a heart attack. Rather than recast the character, Coach was written out. In the season's premiere episode, ""Birth, Death, Love and Rice"", it was revealed that the character of Coach had died, although no explanation was given. As a replacement for Coach, the show's producers created a new character, Woody Boyd, ""an Indiana farm boy"" who becomes a bartender in the bar of big city Boston, portrayed by Woody Harrelson. Before Cheers, Harrelson was an understudy in a Broadway play, Biloxi Blues, and made his film debut in Wildcats, which was released to theaters in February 1986. == Reception == In the 1985–86 season, Cheers was scheduled at 9:00 p.m. (Eastern) / 8:00 p.m. (Central) against CBS's Simon & Simon and ABC's The Colbys, which replaced Lady Blue, which moved to Saturdays in mid-November 1985. On December 26, 1985, the series gained 33 percent in the Niels",1,1,5,1
91,what year did the baltimore ravens win superbowl?,2000,2000 NFL season,"Super Bowl XXXV was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion New York Giants to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2000 season. The Ravens defeated the Giants by a score of 34–7, tied for the seventh largest Super Bowl margin of victory with Super Bowl XXXVII. The game was played on January 28, 2001, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, making it the first time Raymond James Stadium has held a Super Bowl. The Ravens, who posted a 12–4 regular season record, became the third wild card team to win the Super Bowl and the second in four years. The Giants entered the game seeking to go 3–0 in Super Bowls after also finishing the regular season with a 12–4 record. Baltimore allowed only 152 yards of offense by New York (the third-lowest total ever in a Super Bowl), recorded 4 sacks, and forced five turnovers. All sixteen of the Giants' possessions ended with punts or interceptions, with the exception of the last one, which ended when time expired in the game. New York's lone touchdown, a 97-yard kickoff return, was quickly answered by Baltimore on an 84-yard touchdown return on the ensuing kickoff. The Giants became the first team since the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII not to score an offensive touchdown and the fifth overall. This was the fourth Super Bowl where the winning team outscored the losing team in all four quarters. Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis, who made three solo tackles, two assists, and blocked four passes, was named Super Bowl MVP. Counting the 1958 and 1959 NFL Championship Games, this was the fourth title game that involved teams from Baltimore and New York, and the first such matchup since Super Bowl III, in which the New York Jets defeated the Baltimore Colts. A team from Baltimore had not won a Super Bowl since the Colts' victory in 1971. == Background == === Host selection process === NFL owners awarded Super Bowl XXXV to Tampa during their October 31, 1996, meeting in New Orleans. A total of five cities submitted bids: Miami (Joe Robbie Stadium), Atlanta (Georgia Dome), Tampa (Raymond James Stadium), Phoenix/Tempe (Sun Devil Stadium), and Los Angeles (Coliseum). The Los Angeles host committee originally was going to partner with Pasadena (Rose Bowl), but switched their plans to the Coliseum after a renovation plan was announced. However, the Los Angeles bid was dismissed when their delegation failed to convince the owners that planned stadium renovations would be completed in time. Tampa became a favorite after voters passed a ballot measure in September 1996 to fund the construction of a new stadium. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue threw his support behind Tampa based on the new stadium plans. Owners initially planned on selecting only two hosts (XXXIII and XXXIV), but decided to name three after strong showings by the respective delegations. Miami, Atlanta, and Tampa were selected to host XXXIII, XXXIV, and XXXV, respectively. Tampa became the fourth metropolitan area to host the game at least three times, joining New Orleans, Miami, and Los Angeles. === Baltimore Ravens === The Ravens entered the game with the second-best defense in allowing yards in the league, with the fewest points allowed (165) and the fewest rushing yards allowed (970) during the regular season. At the time, they were the only team to hold the opposition to under 1,000 yards rushing in a season since the NFL adopted a 16-game schedule in 1978. Baltimore's 165 points allowed broke the record set by the 1986 Chicago Bears, who had given up 187 points. The Ravens' defense had held their opponents to ten or fewer points in eleven games, including four shutouts. The defense was led by a trio of outstanding linebackers: Peter Boulware, Jamie Sharper, and Ray Lewis. During the regular season, Boulware recorded 7 sacks, while Sharper forced five fumbles and made one interception. Lewis

The Ravens originated when Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell decided to relocate his historic franchise, and he reached a deal with the city of Baltimore to move his team in 1996. As part of the agreement, Cleveland kept the Browns' name, history, and colors for a future replacement team, so the newly renamed Ravens--the moniker stems from the famous poem by Baltimorean Edgar Allan Poe--were technically an expansion team. The franchise's first draft selection was offensive lineman Jonathan Ogden, followed by linebacker Ray Lewis, who quickly became one of the most dominant players in the NFL and helped forge the Ravens' reputation as a team known for its ferocious defense. Jonathan OgdenOffensive lineman Jonathan Ogden of the Baltimore Ravens preparing to block an opposing New York Giants player during Super Bowl XXXV, 2001; the Ravens won the game. After four years without a winning record, the Ravens broke through in 2000. Led by the league's top-ranked defense, the team won 12 games during the regular season and swept through the AFC playoffs, allowing an average of fewer than 6 points per game in the postseason. The Ravens easily defeated the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV the following January, and Lewis was named Most Valuable Player of the game. In addition to Lewis and Ogden, the Super Bowl-winning Ravens squad featured standouts such as tight end Shannon Sharpe and cornerback Rod Woodson. Over the remainder of the decade, the Ravens remained competitive, qualifying for the playoffs in six of the 10 seasons from 2001 to 2010--which included a loss to the rivalPittsburgh Steelers in the AFC championship game following the 2008 season, the first under head coach John Harbaugh--and featuring a defense ranked in the top five for total yardage allowed in six of those years. Robert Griffin IIIBaltimore Ravens quarterback Robert Griffin III during a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, 2019. The team continued its strong play in 2011, when the Ravens won a division title and advanced to another AFC championship game, a close loss to the New England Patriots. The following season the Ravens defeated the Patriots in an AFC title game rematch, and, with a win over the San Francisco 49ers--who were lead by head coach Jim Harbaugh, the brother of John Harbaugh--Baltimore claimed the franchise's second Super Bowl. In 2013 the team's five-year streak of playoff appearances came to an end as the Ravens finished the season with an 8-8 record. The team returned to the postseason the following year and upset the Steelers in its first playoff game before being eliminated in the divisional round. The Ravens were beset by injuries over the course of the 2015 season, which resulted in Baltimore's falling off to a 5-11 record. The Ravens rebounded to a degree in 2016 by going 8-8 and just missing out on a division title. The team slowly improved, returning to the playoffs after capturing a division title during the 2018 season. Baltimore Ravens Results by Season: 2019-23 season record playoffs 2019 14-2 lost in divisional round 2020 11-5 lost in divisional round 2021 8-9 missed playoffs 2022 10-7 lost in wild card round 2023 13-4 lost in conference championship Behind second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson, the Ravens took the league by storm in 2019, using a dynamic offensive scheme to set an NFL record with 3,296 team rushing yards and posting a franchise-best 14-2 record. However, Baltimore suffered a stunning playoff defeat in its opening game, losing to a Tennessee Titans squad that went 9-7 during the regular season. In 2020 the Ravens again qualified for the playoffs, and the team won its wild card game before losing in the divisional round. Baltimore struggled the following season, posting a losing record, 8-9. In 2022 the team returned to the playoffs but made an early exit as it lost in the wild card round. Jackson's strong play in 2023--he threw for 3,678 yards and 24 touchdowns--guided the Ravens to a 13-4 record, and the team easily advanced to the AFC championship game, where it was defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs, the defending Super Bowl champions.

Super Bowl XLVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2012 season. The Ravens defeated the 49ers 34-31, handing the 49ers their first Super Bowl loss in their franchise history. The game was played on Sunday, February 3, 2013, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. This was the seventh Super Bowl played in the Superdome, and the tenth to be played in New Orleans, equaling Miami's record of ten in an individual city. This was the first Super Bowl to be held in New Orleans since Super Bowl XXXVI and it was the first to be played there since Hurricane Katrina struck the city in 2005. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game featured two brothers coaching against each other — Jim and John Harbaugh, head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens, respectively — earning it the nickname Har-bowl. Jim's son and John's nephew, Jay Harbaugh, was also on the Ravens' coaching staff. Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games (Baltimore, 1–0; San Francisco, 5–0). The 49ers, who posted a regular-season record of 11–4–1, entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history (and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season), which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise. The Ravens, who posted a 10–6 regular-season record, made their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, having previously won Super Bowl XXXV. Linebacker Ray Lewis, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) from that game, as well as the last remaining member of the inaugural Ravens roster from 1996, also played in this game, his and 49ers wide receiver Randy Moss' last before both retired from professional football. Baltimore dominated the first half of the game, aided by quarterback Joe Flacco's three touchdown passes that gave the Ravens a 21–3 lead before their lead was cut to 21–6 just before halftime; the Ravens immediately resumed scoring after Jacoby Jones returned the second half kickoff a record 108 yards, increasing their lead to 28–6. However, a partial power outage in the Superdome following the return suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl). After play resumed, San Francisco began to rally, scoring 17 unanswered third-quarter points to cut the Ravens' lead to 28–23. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34–29, the 49ers drove down to the Baltimore 7-yard line just before the two-minute warning but turned the ball over on downs. The Ravens then took an intentional safety in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory. Flacco, who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns, became the fourth consecutive quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP, after Drew Brees at Super Bowl XLIV, Aaron Rodgers at Super Bowl XLV, and Eli Manning at Super Bowl XLVI. CBS broadcast the game in the United States, and charged an average of $4 million for a 30-second commercial during the game, the highest rate for any Super Bowl. According to Nielsen, Super Bowl XLVII was viewed by an estimated average of 108.69 million people in the United States, with a record 164.1 million tuning into at least six minutes of the game. Beyoncé performed in the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, which featured a reunion with fellow Destiny's Child alumni Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. == Background == The game marked the first Super Bowl in which both of the teams had appeared, but had not yet lost a previous Super Bowl; the 49ers came into the game having won all five of their previous Super Bowl appearances, while the Ravens had won in their lone previous Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. Currently, this phenomenon can onl",1,1,5,5

From north to south, San Diego County extends from the southern borders of Orange and Riverside counties to the Mexico–U.S. border and the municipalities of Tijuana and Tecate in Baja California. From west to east, San Diego County stretches from the Pacific Ocean to its boundary with Imperial County, which separated from it in 1907. San Diego County has more than 70 miles (113 km) of coastline. This forms the most densely populated region of the county, which has a mild Mediterranean to semiarid climate and extensive chaparral vegetation, similar to the rest of the western portion of Southern California. Precipitation and temperature extremes increase to the east, with mountains that receive frost and snow in the winter. These lushly forested mountains receive more rainfall than the average in Southern California, while the desert region of the county lies in a rain shadow to the east, which extends into the Desert Southwest region of North America. == History == The area which is now San Diego County has been inhabited for more than 12,000 years by the Kumeyaay (also known as 'Iipai-Tiipai or by the historical Spanish name Diegueño), Luiseño, Cupeño, Cahuilla, and the Acjachemen people and their local predecessors. In 1542, the explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who may have been born in Portugal but sailed under the flag of Castile, claimed San Diego Bay for the Spanish Empire, and he named the site San Miguel. In November 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno surveyed the harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named the area for Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego. European settlement in what is now San Diego County began with the founding of the San Diego Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá by Spanish soldiers and clerics in 1769. This county was part of Alta California under the Viceroyalty of New Spain until the Mexican declaration of independence. From 1821 through 1848, this area was part of Mexico. San Diego County became part of the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, ending the Mexican–American War. This treaty designated the border to pass through a point one marine league south of the southernmost point of the port of San Diego, ensuring that the United States received all of the natural harbor of San Diego Bay. San Diego County was one of the original counties of California, created at the time of California statehood in 1850.: 221 At the time of its establishment in 1850, San Diego County was relatively large, and included all of southernmost California south and east of Los Angeles County. It included areas of what are now Inyo and San Bernardino Counties, as well as all of what are now Riverside and Imperial Counties.: 221 During the later part of the 19th century, there were numerous changes in the boundaries of San Diego County, when various areas were separated to make up the c

93,who was king george vi married to?,Queen Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.,Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,"George VI (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death in 1952. He was also the last Emperor of India from 1936 until the British Raj was dissolved in August 1947, and the first head of the Commonwealth following the London Declaration of 1949. The future George VI was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria; he was named Albert at birth after his great-grandfather Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was known as ""Bertie"" to his family and close friends. His father ascended the throne as George V in 1910. As the second son of the king, Albert was not expected to inherit the throne. He spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Edward, the heir apparent. Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stutter, which he learned to manage to some degree. His elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936, but Edward abdicated later that year to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. As heir presumptive to Edward VIII, Albert became king, taking the regnal name George VI. In September 1939, the British Empire and most Commonwealth countries—but not Ireland—declared war on Nazi Germany, following the invasion of Poland. War with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George VI was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. Britain and its allies were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had largely broken away, followed by the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died at Sandringham House, aged 56, of a coronary thrombosis. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II. == Early life == Albert was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), was the eldest child and only daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been ""rather distressed"". Two days later, he wrote again: ""I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her."" The Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: ""I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good.""

George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 – 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until his death in 1820. The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with George as its king. He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was a monarch of the House of Hanover, who, unlike his two predecessors, was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover. George was born during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King George II, as the first son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Following his father's death in 1751, Prince George became heir apparent and Prince of Wales. He succeeded to the throne on George II's death in 1760. The following year, he married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, with whom he had 15 children. George III's life and reign were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, Britain lost 13 of its North American colonies in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. In 1807, the transatlantic slave trade was banned from the British Empire. In the later part of his life, George had recurrent and eventually permanent mental illness. The exact nature of the mental illness is not known definitively, but historians and medical experts have suggested that his symptoms and behaviour traits were consistent with either bipolar disorder or porphyria. In 1810, George suffered a final relapse, and his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, was named Prince Regent the following year. The King died aged 81, at which time the Regent succeeded him as George IV. George III reigned during much of the Georgian and Regency eras. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch, having reigned for 59 years and 96 days; he remains the longest-lived and longest-reigning male monarch in British history. == Early life == George was born in Norfolk House in St James's Square, London, on 4 June 1738. He was a grandson of King George II and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. As he was born two months prematurely, and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's Church, Piccadilly, and Bishop of Oxford. One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were King Frederick I of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy), and his great-aunt Sophia Dorothea, Queen in Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy). George grew into a healthy, reserved and shy child. The family moved to Leicester Square, where George and his younger brother Edward (later Duke of York and Albany) were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight. He was the first British monarch to study science systematically. Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing and riding. His religious education was wholly Anglican. At the age of 10, George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison's play Cato and said in the",4,1,5,1
94,what football team is michael vick on?,Atlanta Falcons,Philadelphia Eagles,"Michael Dwayne Vick (born June 26, 1980) is an American college football coach and former player who is the head football coach at Norfolk State University. He played quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, where he became the league's first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and was the all-time leader in quarterback rushing yards at the time of his retirement. Vick played college football at Virginia Tech, where he won the Archie Griffin Award as a freshman, and was selected first overall by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2001 NFL draft. During his six years with the Falcons, he was named to three Pro Bowls and led the team to two playoff runs, one division title, and an NFC Championship Game appearance. Vick's NFL career came to a halt in 2007 after he pleaded guilty for his involvement in a dog fighting ring and spent 21 months in federal prison. His arrest and subsequent conviction garnered Vick notoriety with the general public, which lasted throughout the rest of his career. He was released by the Falcons shortly before leaving prison. After serving his sentence, Vick signed with the Philadelphia Eagles for the 2009 season. As a member of the Eagles for five years, he had his greatest statistical season and led the team to a division title in 2010, earning him Comeback Player of the Year and a fourth Pro Bowl selection. In his final two seasons, Vick played for the New York Jets and Pittsburgh Steelers, primarily as a backup. He officially retired in 2017 after spending the 2016 season as a free agent. After retiring as a player, Vick pursued a coaching career. He served as the offensive coordinator and advisor of the Atlanta Legends of Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019. Near the end of the 2024 season, Vick was named the head football coach at Norfolk State. == Early life == Vick was born in Newport News, Virginia, as the third of four children to Brenda Vick and Michael Boddie, then unmarried teenagers. His mother worked two jobs, obtained public financial assistance and had help from her parents, while his father worked long hours in the shipyards as a sandblaster and spray-painter. They were married when Michael was about five years old, but the children elected to continue to use their ""Vick"" surname. The family lived in the Ridley Circle Homes, a public housing project in a financially depressed and crime-ridden neighborhood located in the East End section of the port city. Local residents interviewed in a 2007 newspaper article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that ""not much [had] changed"" nearly a decade after Vick left. One resident said that there was drug dealing, drive-by shootings, and other killings in the neighborhood, and suggested that sports were a way out and a dream for many. In a 2001 interview, Vick told the Newport News Daily Press that when he was 10 or 11, ""I would go fishing even if the fish weren't biting, just to get away from the violence and stress of daily life in the projects."" Boddie's employment required a great deal of travel, but he taught football skills to his two sons at an early age. Vick was only three years old when his father, nicknamed ""Bullet"" for his speed during his own playing days, began teaching him the fundamentals. Michael subsequently taught the game to his younger brother, Marcus Vick. As he grew up, Vick went by the nickname ""Ookie"", and learned about football from Aaron Brooks, a second cousin who was four years older. Vick and Brooks spent a lot of time at the local Boys and Girls Club. ""Sports kept me off the streets,"" Vick told Sporting News magazine in an interview published April 9, 2001. ""It kept me from getting into what was going on, the bad stuff. Lots of guys I knew have had bad problems."" === High school career === Vick first came to prominence while at Homer L. Ferguson High School in Newport News. As a freshman, he impressed many with his athletic ability; he threw for over 400 yards in a game that y

The Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation began in April 2007 with a search of property in Surry County, Virginia, owned by Michael Vick, who was at the time quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons football team, and the subsequent discovery of evidence of a dog fighting ring. Over seventy dogs, mostly pit bull terriers, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized, along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's 15-acre (61,000 m2) property by local, state and federal authorities. The case drew widespread publicity to the issues of animal abuse and dog fighting. It also drew attention to unlawful gambling and drug activities which authorities claim often accompany dog fighting. Subsequently, Vick and three other principals were convicted of federal offense conspiracy charges and imprisoned. Vick was suspended by the NFL, was ordered to pay the Atlanta Falcons back a portion of his earnings, and lost endorsement deals worth millions more. With other creditors also attempting to collect millions of dollars in debts, in July 2008, he filed for Chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcy protection. == Overview == The Bad Newz dog fighting investigation began in April 2007 with a search of property in Surry County, Virginia, owned by Atlanta Falcons' football quarterback Michael Vick, and the subsequent discovery of evidence of a dog fighting ring in Newport News, Virginia. Over 70 dogs, mostly pit bull terriers, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's 15-acre (61,000 m2) property by local, state and federal authorities. In July 2007, Vick and three other men were indicted on federal offense and state felony charges relating to a six-year-long continuing criminal enterprise of an interstate dog fighting ring known as ""Bad Newz Kennels"", based upon a local nickname for Newport News, Vick's hometown. Allegations included Vick's direct involvement in dog fighting, high-stakes gambling, and brutal executions of dogs. Public outcry resulted from widespread news media publicity of the details which included hanging, drowning, electrocuting, ""slamming"", and shooting dogs. There were public demonstrations by both Vick supporters and animal rights activists. In consequence, many companies who had been paying for his endorsements withdrew Vick products from retail marketing when he was convicted. By August 20, all the defendants on the initial federal charges including Vick had agreed to guilty pleas under plea bargain agreements, apparently avoiding facing the possibility of additional and more serious charges under the powerful Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. U.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson, who was not bound by sentencing recommendations in plea agreements, had previously advised two of the defendants that the aggravated circumstances involving executing the dogs warranted an upward revision of the sentencing guidelines. The single felony charges carry a maximum sentence of five years. On November 30, Peace and Phillips were sentenced by Judge Hudson to 18 and 21 months in federal prison respectively. The punishments were higher than recommended by federal prosecutors and included three years of supervised probation following their release from prison. During the sentencing, an attorney for Quanis Phillips argued that his client came from a culture in which dog fighting was an accepted practice. He further claimed that Phillips grew up around it and that it was a proving ground for young men to demonstrate their strength, adding ""Dogfighting was an accepted and acceptable activity in their world."" They attended dogfights as youths. Then, after Vick signed his first NFL contract, ""suddenly there's money for these young men to get dogs ... get involved in this world"". Judge Hudson responded that while they might have grown up seeing dogfighting as normal behavior, that did not temper guilt in this",1,1,5,1

When I arrived in Cairo Ayman contacted me immediately about my tour. He told me I was the only one on my tour ( I wanted to be with others) so he put me with another group. Great decision. Ayman also took care of arranging flights, booking additional tours and getting my covid test to name a few. Everything was taken care of. Everyone with Beyond the Nile tours took such good care of me I could not have asked for more. Being a solo woman traveler I felt very safe . My daughter and I just got back from a wonderful and thrilling trip to Egypt organized by Beyond The Nile Tours. Every single person we met, whether with the tour company or not, was kind, courteous and tried very, very hard to please. And they did. All the Egyptian tours go to the same amazing places, but what made this tour incredible for us were the Tour Guides: Gabber, Hassan and Muhammed were all extremely knowledgable, kind and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. We spent the most time with Hassan Hosny whom we got to know the best and are lucky to call a new friend. He was knowledgable, patient, kind and most endearingly, funny. We had such a great time under his wing. Thank you, Hassan! Here are a couple tips I wish I'd known: Bring a big stack of $1 bills for tips because you will never have enough small Egyptian pounds. You will need the ones every where and for everything including the bathroom. Secondly, insist on a cabin as far to the front of the boat as you can possibly get! We loved our Nile cruise and our boat but were at the back above the motor and the noise and vibration are not pleasant. My only criticism of BTNT is communication, not with the Tour Guides, but with administration. I am not sure if it's language or cultural, but nothing is written down; not prices or itinerary. We had a small snafu at the end of the trip when the US changed its covid test time requirement from 72 to 24 hours. I wanted firm and clear information about when and how we would get the test, how much it would cost and when we would receive the results. I don't think that's too much to ask since so much was riding on that information. In the end, we did get the results in time and were able to board our plane home. We loved our trip to Egypt! Go! You will not regret it. With tourism at a tenth of normal, there will never be a better time. We felt safe every step of the way. Go! Most popular destinations in Egypt Journey through the cradle of civilization.

From cruising the mesmerizing Nile River in style to exploring the wonders of the ancient world such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, Luxor Temple and the Valley of the Kings, there really is no place like Egypt. Top operators in Egypt ""Excellent guides for the entire Tour, particularly from Luxor to Aswan and considering the free spirits we had in our group, its a downright miracle the participant attrition rate was 0%. The hotels and logistics were extremely well organised and we were rarely waiting for buses or transportation. The one major downside is the incorporation of tourist trap stores into the itinerary, the buses take you to businesses with inflated prices and pushy sellers. This is fine in moderation but almost once every day was too much and when it cut into time at actual tourist attractions or downtime on the cruise, the group was livid. Additionally, the tour of the Nubian village should be avoided at all costs. The crocodiles living as 'pets' in grotesquely small cages is unconscionable and this type of tourism should not be condoned or supported. It's no different to petting sedated Tigers in S.E. Asia--it shouldn't ever be done. Beyondthenile Tours should find other partners in the villages to work with, who do not treat crocodiles so poorly, Beyondthenile/Nourbell Tours could really set itself apart from the rest of the competition in Egypt, by providing a clean curated tour of Egypt, that avoids the traps and pitfalls of your average Egypt tour. ""This is a great trip knowing that it is a group tour which involves long bus rides and waking up early. I would recommend this trip to those wanting to see all the highlights of Egypt and Jordan safely. For the extra activities, I would recommend Abu Simbel and the hot air balloon ride at Luxor. It's a bit more expensive but make sure to book the sunrise hot air balloon ride. It is definitely worth it. Make sure to bring some $1,$5,$10USD to use. Not everyone takes the credit card. When exchanging your money to EGP or JD, avoid the airport. When you arrive at the hotel you will meet your tour guide, ask him where to exchange money. The rate will be better. For hotels, their star system is not the same as Canadian star system. Expect 3 star hotels. For food, you will be eating a lot at the hotels or buffets. You will get tired of it. Please remember that you don't need to eat at the place your tour guide takes you. Leave the buffet and find a local restaurant nearby using google map. Not only will you save money but the food is so much better. I would definitely recommend upgrading to a flight from Cairo to Aswan. It will be worth it! And Aswan is nice so you get to have an extra night in Aswan. You could upgrade to the train instead but the train is loud and the bathroom is gross. For Day 4, ask if you can stay on the cruise ship instead of the felucca. The felucca is freezing and you will get eaten by mosquitos. And the bathroom in the felucca is disgusting. If I could change the itinerary of this trip, I would skip the last day in Cairo (day10) and go to Jordan. It would also be nicer if the flight from Cairo to Amman is earlier so you have more time in Amman (but this would be hard to control with airline schedule). With that extra day in Jordan, it would be nicer if we could stay overnight at Dead Sea enjoying the mud mask and floating. With the current itinerary, we only had 30min at the sea and felt rushed. The staff actually shut the water off so we couldn't wash off the mud on our faces. Overall, this trip was one to remember.

What travelers are saying Our flight from Morocco to Cairo was delayed, and I was concerned that my husband and I wouldn't have a ride to Giza. Fortunately, our driver kept in touch and patiently waited for us. After a two-hour delay, when we finally left the airport, I spotted our driver holding a sign with my name. I was thrilled! She took us to our hotel without any further delays. I highly recommend Rimo Tour and especially our kind driver, Captain Iman Mohamed. Thank you. Amazing,life long dream has been achieved.Would recommend going down in to one of the pyramids if you get the chance to get a feel of the place.Keep away from the sellers who try to sell you anything.We just ignore them and kept walking.From Hurghada it is a long day but you will be pleased that you have done it. Loved Loved Loved. Would recommend and choose this tour guide & driver over and over again. Informative and engaging, leaned a lot, you can tell that he is knowledgeable. Loved the little fun facts too. The whole experience was incredible. We were picked up from our hotel at the exact agreed time. We were then taken on a 15 minute drive to the boat. The boat was lovely and comfortable. There were about 4 other small groups that shared the experience with us. We were all debriefed by a group of experienced divers and snorkelers, who made us feel secure and prepared for the activity. I had gone with my mum and brother who is 8 years old and isn't a strong swimmer, however, the team were able to navigate this and were still able to safely guide him through the snorkelling experience for a total of over an hour. Food was also provided, and it was well cooked and served. We didn't see any dolphins but we were able to sea many fish and coral in the Red Sea. We also had the option to pay for high quality photographs taken by photographers who were also skilled divers! They took photos from under water and above water. After the whole experience we were taken back to our hotel by the same driver. The whole experience was definitely one to remember and I will be using their services again in the future!! Passant was an amazing guide. She explained everything in detail and was very sweet and helpful. She helped us with everything we needed and was a helpful sister! If you book Let's explore make sure you ask for Passant as your guide, you will love her! Overall Luxor is like huge open air museum of ancient Egypt, and our tour guide Mohsen helped us experience it! Mohsen has a very easy going personality, just a lovely human being, super knowledgeable and an eloquent speaker. Would definitely recommend him for your trip Beautiful cruise and five star food. Perfect finish to our Cairo trip and will be recommending our family and friends do this. One recommendation would be to serve one glass of wine or beer perhaps (we did the cruise on NY's eve and were hanging out for a drink !!) . Service onboard was friedndly and professional- welcome drink (juices) upon arrival, hot towels, mineral water and complimentary non alcoholic drinks. The host contacted us a few days in advance to share location details for the meeting point and also the dinner menu. So glad we prepaid for the dinner which was only $50 USD for two of us. Overall, this cruise was great value for money and was the highlight of our Cairo trip We used this VIP Meet and Greet service from the Cairo airport to our hotel. The entire experience was outstanding, and I can't recommend this service highly enough! It's worth every penny for the comfort and peace of mind it provides. From the moment we arrived at Cairo International Airport, we felt welcomed and at ease, even though it was after 10:30 p.m. We were greeted by our driver, Kyro, who was holding a sign with our name on it. He was punctual, professional, and ready to assist with our luggage. He then handled getting our Visas so that when we went through customs and passport control, we didn't have to wait in the long line and passed right through. Kyro was courteous and knowledgeable, providing us with insights about the city and life in Cairo. The journey to my hotel took around 40 minutes. We were impressed by the driver's skill in navigating the crazy traffic in Cairo. The drop-off was smooth, and he even helped us with our bags to the hotel entrance.

Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as ""the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world."" The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism. The painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797. The painting's global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism—a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arsène Lupin), and the song ""Mona Lisa"" recorded by Nat King Cole—one of the most successful songs of the 1950s. The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962, equivalent to $1 billion as of 2023. == Title and subject == The title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, is based on the presumption that it depicts Lisa del Giocondo, although her likeness is uncertain. Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that ""Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife."" Monna in Italian is a polite form of address originating as ma donna—similar to Ma'am, Madam, or my lady in English. This became madonna, and its contraction monna. The title of the painting is spelled in Italian as Monna Lisa (mona being a vulgarity in Italian), which is rare in English, where it is traditionally spelled Mona. Lisa del Giocondo was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea. The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means ""jocund"" (""happy"" or ""jovial""), or literally ""the jocund one"", a pun on the feminine form of Lisa's married name, Giocondo. In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning. Vasari's account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo's assistant Salaì, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo. That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo. In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document,

Who was the Mona Lisa in real life? There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the Mona Lisa's sitter. Scholars and historians have posited numerous possibilities, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (nee Gherardini), wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo--hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda. That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari. How many years did it take to paint the Mona Lisa? Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519. He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times. Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo's late period. Where is the real Mona Lisa kept? The Mona Lisa hangs behind bulletproof glass in a gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it has been a part of the museum's collection since 1804. It was part of the royal collection before becoming the property of the French people during the Revolution (1787-99). What is the value of the Mona Lisa? The Mona Lisa is priceless. Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!) would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting. Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it. The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment. Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement. Why is the Mona Lisa so famous? Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece's celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.S. in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation. The Mona Lisa's fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting's inherent appeal. Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world's most famous painting. It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century. The sitter's mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination. Subject Unraveling the mystery behind the Mona LisaOverview of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, with a discussion of the sitter's identity. The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape. Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo's achievement. The three-quarter view, in which the sitter's position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century. The subject's softly sculptural face shows Leonardo's skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo's studied observations and inexhaustible patience. Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter's hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her. The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting--especially apparent in the sitter's faint smile--reflects Leonardo's idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo's vision. In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits. Who was the subject of the Mona Lisa?Learn about efforts to identify the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona Lisa (c. 1503-19). There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait's sitter. Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (nee Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda. That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari. Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo's mother, Caterina. That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa's mysterious smile emerged from a--perhaps unconscious--memory of Caterina's smile. A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo's self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter's and the artist's facial features. Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist's riddle. The sitter's identity has not been definitively proven. Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo's remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive. History Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519. He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times. Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo's late period. French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist's death, and it became part of the royal collection. For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787-99). Following a period hanging in Napoleon's bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century. In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation. People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum's director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects. Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting. Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa. He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion. Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France. Condition Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age. The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers. To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting. Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail. The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject's left elbow. The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work's visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it.

Video transcript Dr. Steven Zucker: [0:04] We're in the single most crowded room in the Louvre, but for good reason. This is the room that holds the ""Mona Lisa"" by Leonardo da Vinci. Without a doubt, the most famous painting in the world. Dr. Beth Harris: [0:14] Of course, it's her smile that's so famous today. It certainly is a smile that doesn't clearly tell us what she's feeling. It's ambiguous. Dr. Zucker: [0:24] I think it allows people to read into it in any way that they prefer. Dr. Harris: [0:28] Sigmund Freud, for example, saw a combination of a maternal gaze, but also a gaze that was flirtatious. I think I do see both of those aspects here. [0:40] This is a portrait of the wife of a Florentine merchant, and as we look out at the sea of people taking selfies in front of the Mona Lisa, it's good to remember that only the elite could have their portrait painted during the Renaissance. This was an expensive proposition. And of course, you'd have to go and sit for the artist many times so that he could capture your likeness. Dr. Zucker: [1:01] Because they were expensive, they were reserved for kings and queens and the nobility. [1:06] What we see during the Renaissance is the growth of the merchant class. The fact that a wealthy merchant would hire Leonardo to paint his wife's portrait is a reminder of the fortunes that are being made by traders, by bankers, and others during the Renaissance. Dr. Harris: [1:20] Well, especially in the city of Florence, which was such an economic hub during the Renaissance. We know, in fact, that the patron of this painting was a cloth merchant. Dr. Zucker: [1:29] This painting has quite a number of innovations, but one of the most important is that it's half-length. Generally, portraits were busts, that is, from the chest up. Dr. Harris: [1:38] This was an incredibly influential new formula for the portrait. If you think about the standard form of the portrait before this with the figure in profile, bust length, it's a very static pose, very formal, very stiff. [1:52] But as soon as Leonardo turned the head toward us, positioned the shoulders three-quarter toward us also, and included the hands, suddenly we had an image of a figure that was much more natural, someone who you could imagine having a conversation with. [2:08] Portraits that included a background and that also included the hands did exist in the Northern Renaissance. But this is a new formula for Italy, and will be tremendously influential with artists like Raphael and others. Dr. Zucker: [2:23] Another very influential aspect of this painting is a technique that Leonardo employed which is known as ""sfumato."" That simply means ""smoke."" [2:30] What it refers to is the slightly hazy quality that Leonardo introduces to remove the sometimes sharp quality that existed in early Renaissance paintings, where each object looks too isolated. It's an atmospheric quality that creates a sense of unity throughout the painting. Dr. Harris: [2:47] And makes the figure appear to almost emerge out of the darkness. So we see that she's seated on a chair in a loggia, [an] open porchway. [2:57] We see on either side of her what look like the base of two columns. We don't know if the painting was cut down and there were originally full columns on either side of her, but we do know that early copies of this painting do show those columns on either side of the figure. Dr. Zucker: [3:14] There's a lot about this painting that we don't fully understand. This was a commission, and yet Leonardo kept the painting. He never delivered it to the man who commissioned it. Later in Leonardo's life, when he moved to France, he brought the painting with him, which is why it's now in the Louvre. [3:28] One question that I think we should address is why is this the most famous image in the world. Dr. Harris: [3:33] It reminds me of another very famous image of a woman that's very ambiguous and mysterious. That's ""The Woman with a Pearl Earring"" by Vermeer from more than a century later. Perhaps our culture has some fascination with images of mysterious women. Dr. Zucker: [3:50] I think that's probably an important part of it, but then I think fame grows on itself. In 1911, the painting was stolen, and it was headlines around the world. That accelerated its fame. It has become the subject of numerous other paintings by artists as diverse as Marcel Duchamp or Andy Warhol. This raises an interesting issue. [4:09] Here's a painting that was made for a private home, to exist in a domestic interior to celebrate a man's wife or to celebrate a specific occasion, perhaps the birth of a child or the purchasing of a new home. But here it is instead in a huge gallery with hundreds of people, a painting that exists in millions of multiples around the world. [4:30] It's such an unexpected fate for what Leonardo surely saw as a relatively minor commission. [4:36] [music] Portraits were once rare We live in a culture that is so saturated with images, it may be difficult to imagine a time when only the wealthiest people had their likeness captured. The wealthy merchants of renaissance Florence could commission a portrait, but even they would likely only have a single portrait painted during their lifetime. A portrait was about more than likeness, it spoke to status and position. In addition, portraits generally took a long time to paint, and the subject would commonly have to sit for hours or days, while the artist captured their likeness. The most recognized painting in the world The Mona Lisa was originally this type of portrait, but over time its meaning has shifted and it has become an icon of the Renaissance--perhaps the most recognized painting in the world. The Mona Lisa is a likely a portrait of the wife of a Florentine merchant. For some reason however, the portrait was never delivered to its patron, and Leonardo kept it with him when he went to work for Francis I, the King of France. The Mona Lisa's mysterious smile has inspired many writers, singers, and painters. Here's a passage about the Mona Lisa, written by the Victorian-era (19th-century) writer Walter Pater: We all know the face and hands of the figure, set in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea. Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has chilled it least. The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire. Hers is the head upon which all ""the ends of the world are come,"" and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed! Piero della Francesca's Portrait of Battista Sforza is typical of portraits during the Early Renaissance (before Leonardo); figures were often painted in strict profile, and cut off at the bust. Often the figure was posed in front of a birds-eye view of a landscape. A new formula With Leonardo's portrait, the face is nearly frontal, the shoulders are turned three-quarters toward the viewer, and the hands are included in the image. Leonardo uses his characteristic sfumato--a smokey haziness--to soften outlines and create an atmospheric effect around the figure. When a figure is in profile, we have no real sense of who she is, and there is no sense of engagement. With the face turned toward us, however, we get a sense of the personality of the sitter. Northern Renaissance artists such as Hans Memling (see the Portrait of a Young Man at Prayer) had already created portraits of figures in positions similar to the Mona Lisa. Memling had even located them in believable spaces. Leonardo combined these Northern innovations with Italian painting's understanding of the three dimensionality of the body and the perspectival treatment of the surrounding space. A recent discovery An important copy of the Mona Lisa was recently discovered in the collection of the Prado in Madrid. The background had been painted over, but when the painting was cleaned, scientific analysis revealed that the copy was likely painted by another artist who sat beside Leonardo and copied his work, brush-stroke by brush-stroke. The copy gives us an idea of what the Mona Lisa might look like if layers of yellowed varnish were removed.

What are the five boroughs of New York City? The five boroughs of New York City are Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. Why is New York City important in the United States? New York City is the largest and most influential American metropolis and the most populous and the most international city in the country. Located where the Hudson and East rivers empty into one of the world's premier harbors, New York is both the gateway to the North American continent and its preferred exit to the oceans of the globe. What does the seal of New York City look like? The seal of the city of New York was adopted in 1686. It includes a beaver and a flour barrel, images that document the first major phase of Manhattan's economic history, the fur trade and flour exports. What is the average temperature of New York City? The average temperature of New York City is about 31 degF (0 degC) in January and about 72 degF (22 degC) in June, but recorded temperature extremes range from -15 to 106 degF (-26 to 41 degC). The annual precipitation is 44 inches (1,120 mm). Because of New York's moderate climate, the harbor rarely freezes. New York City, city and port located at the mouth of the Hudson River, southeastern New York state, northeastern U.S. It is the largest and most influential American metropolis, encompassingManhattan and Staten islands, the western sections of Long Island, and a small portion of the New York state mainland to the north of Manhattan. New York City is in reality a collection of many neighbourhoods scattered among the city's five boroughs--Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island--each exhibiting its own lifestyle. Moving from one city neighbourhood to the next may be like passing from one country to another. New York is the most populous and the most international city in the country. Its urban area extends into adjoining parts of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Located where the Hudson and East rivers empty into one of the world's premier harbours, New York is both the gateway to the North American continent and its preferred exit to the oceans of the globe.

Character of the city New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more images to the collectiveconsciousness of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. Its symbol is the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the arena in which Emma Lazarus's ""tempest-tost"" people of every nation are transformed into Americans--and if they remain in the city, they become New Yorkers. Why are New York City's bagels so good?Discover the chemistry of what makes the bagels in New York City taste distinctive. For the past two centuries, New York has been the largest and wealthiest American city. More than half the people and goods that ever entered the United States came through its port, and that stream of commerce has made change a constant presence in city life. New York always meant possibility, for it was an urban centre on its way to something better, a metropolis too busy to be solicitous of those who stood in the way of progress. New York--while the most American of all the country's cities--thus also achieved a reputation as both foreign and fearsome, a place where turmoil, arrogance, incivility, and cruelty tested the stamina of everyone who entered it. The city was inhabited by strangers, but they were, as James Fenimore Cooper explained, ""essentially national in interest, position, pursuits. No one thinks of the place as belonging to a particular state but to the United States."" Once the capital of both its state and the country, New York surpassed such status to become a world city in both commerce and outlook, with the most famous skyline on earth. It also became a target for international terrorism--most notably the destruction in 2001 of the World Trade Center, which for three decades had been the most prominent symbol of the city's global prowess. However, New York remains for its residents a conglomeration of local neighbourhoods that provide them with familiar cuisines, languages, and experiences. A city of stark contrasts and deep contradictions, New York is perhaps the most fitting representative of a diverse and powerful nation. The landscape The city site Central New York CityCentral New York City, depicting the borough of Manhattan southward from Central Park. Sections of the granite bedrock of New York date to about 100 million years ago, but the topography of the present city is largely the product of the glacial recession that marked the end of the Wisconsin Glacial Stage about 10,000 years ago. Great erratic boulders in Manhattan's Central Park, deep kettle depressions in Brooklyn and Queens, and the glacial moraine that remains in parts of the metropolitan area provide silent testimony to the enormous power of the ice. Glacial retreat also carved out the waterways around the city. The Hudson and East rivers, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, and Arthur Kill are, in reality, estuaries of the Atlantic Ocean, and the Hudson is tidal as far north as Troy. The approximately 600 miles (1,000 km) of New York shoreline are locked in constant combat with the ocean, as it erodes the land and adds new sediments elsewhere. Although the harbour is constantly dredged, ship channels are continually filled with river silt and are too shallow for more modern deep-sea vessels. South of the rockbound terrain of Manhattan stretches a sheltered deepwater anchorage offering easy access to the Atlantic Ocean. In 1524 the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to enter the harbour, which he named Santa Margarita, and he reported that the hills surrounding the vast expanse of New York Bay appeared to be rich in minerals; more than 90 species of precious stone and 170 of the world's minerals have actually been found in New York. Verrazzano's daring expedition was commemorated in 1964, when what was then the world's longest suspension bridge was dedicated to span the Narrows at the entrance to Upper New York Bay.

Only the third largest American port at the time of the American Revolution, New York gradually achieved trade domination and by the mid-1800s handled more than half of the country's oceangoing travelers and commercial trade. After 1900 New York was the world's busiest port, a distinction it held until the 1950s. Cargo containerization, the obsolescence of its waterfront piers, and soaring labour costs shifted business to the New Jersey side of the river after the 1960s, but at the beginning of the 21st century the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey still dominated the water trade of the northeastern United States.

New York City has been called the media capital of the world. The media of New York City are internationally influential and include some of the most important newspapers, largest publishing houses, biggest record companies, and most prolific television studios in the world. It is a major global center for the book, magazine, music, newspaper, and television industries. The Pew Research Center report ""One-in-five U.S. newsroom employees live in New York, Los Angeles or D.C."" showcases 12 percent of all U.S. newsroom employees—reporters, editors, photographers, live in New York City while only 7 percent of the U.S. working-age population lives in New York City. New York is also the largest media market in North America (followed by Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto). Some of the city's media conglomerates include CNN (CNN Global), the Hearst Corporation, NBCUniversal, The New York Times Company, the Fox Corporation and News Corp, the Thomson Reuters Corporation, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Paramount Global. Seven of the world's top eight global advertising agency networks are headquartered in New York. Three of the ""Big Four"" record labels are also headquartered or co-headquartered in the city. One-third of all American independent films are produced in New York. More than 200 newspapers and 350 consumer magazines have an office in the city and the book-publishing industry employs about 25,000 people. Two of the three U.S. national daily newspapers with the largest circulations in the United States are published in New York: The Wall Street Journal; and The New York Times, nicknamed ""the Grey Lady"", which has won the most Pulitzer Prizes for journalism and is considered the U.S. media's ""newspaper of record"". Major tabloid newspapers in the city include the New York Daily News, which was founded in 1919 by Joseph Medill Patterson, and the New York Post, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. Newsday, a Long Island newspaper, is also widely circulated in the city. The city also has a major ethnic press, with 270 newspapers and magazines published in more than 40 languages. El Diario La Prensa is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation. The New York Amsterdam News, published in Harlem, is a prominent African-American newspaper. The Village Voice was the largest alternative newspaper until it ceased publishing in 2018. The television industry developed in New York and is a significant employer in the city's economy. The four major American broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC, are all headquartered in New York. Many cable channels are based in the city as well, including CNN, MSNBC, MTV, Fox News, HBO, and Comedy Central. In 2005 there were more than 100 television shows taped in New York City. New York is also a major center for non-commercial media. The oldest public-access cable television channel in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, founded in 1971. WNET is the city's major public television station and a primary provider of national Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) programming. WNYC, a public radio station owned by the city until 1997, has the largest public radio audience in the United States. The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYC Media, that produces several original New York Emmy Award–winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods, as well as city government-access television (GATV). New York City is home to a number of major online media companies, including Yahoo! and its operations under the AOL brand, along with news and entertainment companies like BuzzFeed and VICE Media. == Media industry profiles == === Book publishing === The book publishing industry in the United States is based in New York.

98,who is the voice of kitt?,Mandel Patinkin voiced KITT in the 2008 film and the reboot series.,Val Kilmer,"KITT or K.I.T.T. is the common name of two fictional characters from the action franchise Knight Rider. In both instances, KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module in the body of a highly advanced, very mobile, robotic automobile. The original KITT is known as the Knight Industries Two Thousand, which appeared in the original TV series Knight Rider as a 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. The second KITT is known as the Knight Industries Three Thousand, which appeared first in the two-hour 2008 pilot film for a new Knight Rider TV series and then the new series itself, and appeared as a 2008–2009 Ford Shelby GT500KR. During filming, KITT was voiced by a script assistant, with voice actors recording KITT's dialog later. David Hasselhoff and original series voice actor William Daniels first met each other six months after the series began filming. KITT's nemesis is KARR, whose name is an acronym of Knight Automated Roving Robot. KARR was voiced first by Peter Cullen and later by Paul Frees in seasons one and three, respectively, of the NBC original TV series Knight Rider. A 1991 sequel film, Knight Rider 2000, is centered on KITT's original microprocessor unit transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be his successor, the Knight Industries Four Thousand (Knight 4000), voiced by Carmen Argenziano and William Daniels. Val Kilmer voiced KITT in the 2008–2009 Knight Rider series. == Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT) == In the original Knight Rider series, the character of KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) was physically embodied as a modified 1982 Pontiac Trans Am. KITT was designed by customizer Michael Scheffe. The convertible and super-pursuit KITTs were designed and built by George Barris. === Development === In the history of the television show, the first KITT, voiced by William Daniels, was said to have been designed by the late Wilton Knight, a brilliant but eccentric billionaire, who established the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG) and its parent Knight Industries. The 2008 film implies that Charles Graiman, creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand, also had a hand in designing the first KITT. An unknown number of KITT's systems were designed at Stanford University. KITT's total initial production cost was estimated at $11,400,000 in 1982 (Episode 5, ""Just My Bill""). The 1991 movie Knight Rider 2000 saw the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) in pieces, and Michael Knight himself reviving the Knight 2000 microprocessor unit, which is eventually transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be the original KITT's direct successor, the Knight 4000. The new vehicle was a modified 1991 Dodge Stealth, appearing similar to the Pontiac Banshee prototype. In the 1997–1998 spin-off series Team Knight Rider, KITT is employed as a shadow advisor. It is later revealed that ""The Shadow"" is actually a hologram run by KITT. In ""Knight of the Living Dead"", Graiman states a third KITT exists as a backup. When KITT is about to die, his memories are downloaded so the third KITT can use them. However, the third backup is never used. While both the 2008 film and the reboot series appear to be a revamp of the original series, they offer some continuity from the original. The ""new"" or ""second"" KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) is a different vehicle and microprocessor unit. In Knight Rider 2000, it is stated that most of the Knight 2000 parts had been sold off. However, Graiman's garage in the 2008 film shows a more complete collection of parts than in the boxes recovered by Michael Knight in Knight Rider 2000. The original Knight Industries Two Thousand is also shown in the pilot movie (although in pieces) in the scene where the garage of Charles Graiman (creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand and implied co-designer of the original KITT) is searched by antagonists. A Trans-Am body (without its hood) is partially covered by a tarp, on which rests the rear

Eartha Mae Kitt (née Keith; January 17, 1927 – December 25, 2008) was an American singer and actress. She was known for her highly distinctive singing style and her 1953 recordings of ""C'est si bon"" and the Christmas novelty song ""Santa Baby"". Kitt began her career in 1942 and appeared in the 1945 original Broadway theatre production of the musical Carib Song. In the early 1950s, Kitt had six US Top 30 entries, including ""Uska Dara"" (1953) and ""I Want to Be Evil"" (1953). Her other recordings include the UK Top 10 song ""Under the Bridges of Paris"" (1954), ""Just an Old Fashioned Girl"" (1956) and ""Where Is My Man"" (1983). Orson Welles once called her the ""most exciting woman in the world"". Kitt starred as Catwoman in the third and final season of the television series Batman in 1967. In 1968, Kitt's career in the U.S. deteriorated after she made anti-Vietnam War statements at a White House luncheon. Ten years later, Kitt made a successful return to Broadway in the 1978 original production of the musical Timbuktu!, for which she received the first of her two Tony Award nominations. Kitt's second was for the 2000 original production of the musical The Wild Party. Kitt wrote three autobiographies. Kitt found a new generation of fans through her various voice acting roles in the last decade of her life. She voiced the villains Yzma and Vexus in The Emperor's New Groove franchise and My Life As A Teenage Robot, with the former earning her two Daytime Emmy Awards. Kitt posthumously won a third Emmy in 2010 for her guest performance on Wonder Pets!. == Early life == Eartha Mae Keith was born in the small town of North, South Carolina, on January 17, 1927. Her mother, Annie Mae Keith (later Annie Mae Riley), was of Cherokee and African descent. Though she had little knowledge of her father, it was reported that he was the son of the owner of the plantation where she had been born, and that Kitt was conceived by rape. In a 2013 biography, British journalist John Williams claimed that Kitt's father was a white man, a local doctor named Daniel Sturkie. Kitt's daughter, Kitt McDonald Shapiro, has questioned the accuracy of the claim. Eartha's mother soon went to live with a black man who refused to accept Eartha because of her relatively pale complexion. Kitt was raised by a relative named Aunt Rosa, in whose household she was abused. After the death of Annie Mae, Eartha was sent to live with another close relative named Mamie Kitt (who Eartha later came to believe was her biological mother) in Harlem, New York City, where Eartha attended the Metropolitan Vocational High School (later renamed the High School of Performing Arts). == Career == Kitt began her career as a member of the Katherine Dunham Company in 1943 and remained a member of the troupe until 1948. A talented singer with a distinctive voice, Kitt recorded the hits ""Let's Do It"", ""Champagne Taste"", ""C'est si bon"" (which Stan Freberg famously burlesqued), ""Just an Old Fashioned Girl"", ""Monotonous"", ""Je cherche un homme"", ""Love for Sale"", ""I'd Rather Be Burned as a Witch"", ""Kâtibim"" (a Turkish melody), ""Mink, Schmink"", ""Under the Bridges of Paris"", and her most recognizable hit ""Santa Baby"", which was released in 1953. Kitt's unique style was enhanced as she became fluent in French during her years performing in Europe. Kitt spoke four languages and sang in 11, which she demonstrated in many of the live recordings of her cabaret performances. === Career peaks === In 1950, Orson Welles gave Kitt her first starring role as Helen of Troy in his staging of Dr. Faustus. Two years later, Kitt was cast in the revue New Faces of 1952, introducing ""Monotonous"" and ""Bal, Petit Bal"", two songs with which she is still identified. In 1954, 20th Century-Fox distributed an independently filmed version of the revue entitled New Faces, in which Kitt performed ""Monotonous"", ""Uska Dara"", ""C'est si bon"", and ""Santa Baby"". Though it is often alleged that Welles and Kitt had an affair during her

99,when does daylight saving end in new zealand 2012?,The period for daylight saving time in New Zealand ended on the first Sunday in March in 2012.,nz,"Daylight Saving Time comes around quickly each year in New Zealand and Australia. See the tables below for more specific details of Specific Dates. The following States and Territories do have Daylight Saving: New South Wales Victoria ACT / Canberra South Australia Tasmania You can refer to the tables below for more information of DLS start and end dates over the coming years up to 2019 for both Australia and New Zealand! Start DLS later in 2014: For those interested in when daylight savings starts later in 2014 this is for you. Before you head to bed on Saturday 4th October 2014 you need to move all of your watches and clocks forward 1 hour in Australia. This same procedure needs to be done on the night of Saturday 27th September 2014 if you live in New Zealand. This will ensure all of the times are correctly set to DLS time when you awake Sunday morning 28th September 2014 in NZ or 5th October 2014 in Oz. End DLS 2015: Before you go to bed on Saturday night 5th April 2015 (in both New Zealand and Australia) you need to set all of your clocks and watches back 1 hour. So when you get up on the morning of Sunday 6th April 2015 your clocks will all show the correct time. Note: smart phones, computers and other electronic equipment may already have inbuilt DLS settings and so you may not need to manually change the time on these devices. These are the important dates to mark on your calendar if you live in one of these areas of our nation. This table shows important Australian Daylight Savings dates up to 2019. Aust Start DLS Year Start DLS Date Aust End DLS Year End DLS Date 2011 Sunday 2 Oct 2012 Sunday 1 April 2012 Sunday 7 Oct 2013 Sunday 7 April 2013 Sunday 6 Oct 2014 Sunday 6 April 2014 Sunday 5 Oct 2015 Sunday 5 April 2015 Sunday 4 Oct 2016 Sunday 3 April 2016 Sunday 2 Oct 2017 Sunday 2 April 2017 Sunday 1 Oct 2018 Sunday 1 April 2018 Sunday 7 Oct 2019 Sunday 7 April 2019 Sunday 6 Oct 2020 Sunday 5 April At 2am on Sunday 5th October 2014 the clocks in the States and Territories above all need to be moved forward an hour to 3am. The easiest way to remember to do this is before retiring for the night on Saturday 4th October 2014, just set your clocks an hour faster. This way when you awake on Sunday morning your clocks will all be set correctly. Then in 2015 you will need to set your clocks back an hour at the end of Daylight Savings time. So at 3am on April 5th 2015 the clocks need to be turned back to 2am. So before going to bed on Saturday 4th April 2015 move your clocks all back one hour and you will be all set with the correct times when you get up on Sunday morning the 5th of April 2015. The States and Territories that do not currently have DLS are: Queensland Western Australia Northern Territory It is also important to keep Daylight Savings in mind when you are travelling between different states as it can become confusing if you are not aware of the different times in each area. This can especially become a problem in areas such as the Gold Coast that does not currently have Daylight savings and yet is on the border with Tweed Heads, in NSW, that does have Daylight saving time. If you mark the dates above in your calendar, then you should be fine and not become confused with the time differences. Daylight Savings Time New Zealand New Zealand also has daylight, but the dates are slightly different from Australia, but also involves moving the clocks forward an hour at the start of the season. NZ Start DLS Date NZ End DLS Date Last Sunday in September First Sunday in April So if you are in New Zealand, or travelling to New Zealand then do the following: Last Sunday in September: Put all clocks forward One hour on the last Saturday night in September, before retiring to bed.

Time in New Zealand is divided by law into two standard time zones. The main islands use New Zealand Standard Time (NZST), 12 hours in advance of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) / military M (Mike), while the outlying Chatham Islands use Chatham Standard Time (CHAST), 12 hours 45 minutes in advance of UTC / military M^ (Mike-Three). During summer months – from the last Sunday in September until the first Sunday in April – daylight saving time is observed and clocks are advanced one hour. New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT) is 13 hours ahead of UTC, and Chatham Daylight Time (CHADT) 13 hours 45 minutes ahead. New Zealand's associated states – the Cook Islands and Niue – and the dependent territory of Tokelau use several different time zones at their own discretion. == History == On 2 November 1868, New Zealand officially adopted a standard time to be observed nationally, and was the first country to do so, about fifteen years before any other. Chatham Island was 45 minutes ahead of mainland New Zealand [twelve hours and fifteen minutes ahead of Coordinated Universal Time]. It was based on longitude 172° 30′ East of Greenwich, 11+1⁄2 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This standard was known as New Zealand Mean Time (NZMT). In 1941, during the Second World War, clocks were advanced half an hour, to reduce electric power use making New Zealand 12 hours ahead of GMT. This change was made permanent from 1946 by the Standard Time Act 1945, at which the time at the 180°E meridian was made the basis for New Zealand Time. NZST remained half an hour ahead of NZMT, and the Chatham Islands 45 minutes ahead of NZST. In the late 1940s the atomic clock was developed and several laboratories began atomic time scales. A new time scale known as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) was adopted internationally in 1972. This was based on the readings of atomic clocks, updated periodically in accordance with time variations in the Earth's rotation by the addition or deletion of seconds (called leap seconds). The Time Act 1974 defines New Zealand Standard Time as 12 hours in advance of UTC. In 2011, the New Zealand dependency of Tokelau moved its time zone forward by 24 hours, by skipping 30 December to be in the UTC+13:00 time zone, the same zone as New Zealand daylight saving. == Daylight saving time (DST) == Starting in 1909, a member of Parliament, Sir Thomas Kay Sidey annually put forward a bill to advance the clocks an hour from September to the following March and the Summer Time Act 1927 succeeded. In 1927, clocks were advanced by an hour from first Sunday in November to the first Sunday in March. This proved unpopular, so the Summer Time Act 1928 revised this to a half-hour shift from 14 October 1928 (second Sunday) to 17 March 1929 (third Sunday), then the Summer Time Act 1929 permanently fixed this half-hour shift to run from the second Sunday in October to the third Sunday in March every year. In 1933, the period was extended from the first Sunday in September to the last Sunday in April. This continued until the Second World War, when emergency regulations in 1941 extended daylight saving to cover the whole year with annual re-applications until the Standard Time Act 1945 made the abandonment of NZMT permanent in 1946, so that 180° becomes the base longitude and what was called NZ Summer Time (NZST) became NZ Standard Time. The Time Act 1974 empowered the governor-general to declare by Order in Council a period when daylight saving time is to be observed. This was a one-hour shift (on top of the earlier half-hour shift) from the first Sunday in November to the last Sunday in February, promptly changed the next year by The New Zealand Time Order 1975 which fixed the period of observance from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in March. In 1985 a comprehensive survey was undertaken by the Department of Internal Affairs. Public attitudes towards NZDT (New Zealand Daylight Time) and its effects on work, recreation and part

History of daylight saving in NZ New Zealand first introduced daylight saving time in 1927. The current times have been fixed since 2007. 1868 -- New Zealand officially set a national standard time -- called New Zealand Mean Time -- at 11 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). 1927 -- New Zealand first observed daylight saving time. The dates and time difference were changed several times over the following years. 1941 -- New Zealand summer time was extended by emergency regulations to cover the whole year. 1946 -- New Zealand summer time (12 hours in advance of GMT) was adopted as New Zealand standard time. Daylight saving time was effectively discontinued at this point. 1974-5 -- Daylight saving was trialled again in 1974, and introduced in 1975. Daylight saving time is 1 hour ahead of New Zealand standard time. 1985 -- Public attitudes were surveyed and over the next few years the period of daylight saving time was extended twice. 2006-07 -- Following public debate and a petition presented to Parliament the period of daylight saving was extended to its current dates. New Zealand observes daylight saving from the last Sunday in September to the first Sunday in April. 2008 -- Daylight saving public attitude survey.
